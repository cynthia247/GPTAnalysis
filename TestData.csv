1,"How can I use an object initializer with an explicit interface implementation in C#? public interface IType { string Property1 { get; set; } } public class Type1 : IType { string IType.Property1 { get; set; } } ... //doesn't work var v = new Type1 { IType.Property1 = ""myString"" }; ","You can't. The only way to access an explicit implementation is through a cast to the interface. ((IType)v).Property1 = ""blah""; You could theoretically wrap a proxy around the property, and then use the proxy property in initialization. (The proxy uses the cast to the interface.) class Program { static void Main() { Foo foo = new Foo() { ProxyBar = ""Blah"" }; } } class Foo : IFoo { string IFoo.Bar { get; set; } public string ProxyBar { set { (this as IFoo).Bar = value; } } } interface IFoo { string Bar { get; set; } } "
2,What is the best way to know if a network path(e.g. //192.168.1.1/test) exist using python in linux? ,"If by ""path"" you mean an internet URL, you'll want to look at the urllib module. from urllib import urlopen try: urlopen(path) except IOError: pass # does not exist else: pass # does exist If by ""path"" you mean a Windows UNC, then you'll want to use the os module. import os os.path.isdir(path) Note, I've found the Windows UNC paths somewhat flakey. Depending on your network setup and permissions, they may or may not be accessible. "

6,"I have heard the terms DDL and DML in reference to databases, but I don't understand what they are. What are they and how do they relate to SQL? "," The following is adapted from here MySQL What is DDL, DML and DCL?: DDL DDL is short name of Data Definition Language, which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database. CREATE – to create database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure, function and triggers). ALTER – alters the structure of the existing database. DROP – delete objects from the database. TRUNCATE – remove all records from a table; also, all spaces allocated for the records are removed. COMMENT – add comments to the data dictionary. RENAME – rename an object. DML DML is short name of Data Manipulation Language which deals with data manipulation, and includes most common SQL statements such SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE etc, and it is used to store, modify, retrieve, delete and update data in database. SELECT – retrieve data from one or more tables. INSERT – insert data into a table. UPDATE – updates existing data within a table. DELETE – delete all records from a table. MERGE – UPSERT operation (insert or update) CALL – call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram. EXPLAIN PLAN – interpretation of the data access path. LOCK TABLE – concurrency control. DCL DCL is short name of Data Control Language which includes commands such as GRANT, and mostly concerned with rights, permissions and other controls of the database system. GRANT – allow users access privileges to database. REVOKE – withdraw users access privileges given by using the GRANT command. TCL TCL is short name of Transaction Control Language which deals with transaction within a database. COMMIT – commits a transaction. ROLLBACK – rollback a transaction in case of any error occurs. SAVEPOINT – a point inside a transaction that allows rollback state to what it was at the time of the savepoint. SET TRANSACTION – specify characteristics for the transaction. "
7,"Does anyone know why .hide(""normal"") does not seem to be working in jQuery 1.4.2? Is it a bug, has it been removed or am I just crazy? I've managed to duplicate this using several different scenarios.

Update: It seems jQuery UI 1.8 is the issue, breaking ""normal"" as an animation speed. This is from the jQuery UI forums: Thanks for pointing that out. Normal was actually never a valid speed option, it was a myth from invalid documentation (used to exist in jQuery core docs as well). The only reason that it worked is because invalid values fall back to the default speed. So it seems at least this member of the jQuery UI team doesn't think this is a breaking change, I strongly disagree and hope this is reversed in the next update. "
8,i want to declare a global linked list for a namespace in c#. i tried to extern the linked list but do not know the correct syntax. can any one tell me how to extern variables? ,"I think the C# syntax for extern is much more limited, or even radically different, from the C++ world. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/e59b22c5(v=VS.80).aspx .

9,"Like how the click() can be used to trigger a click event on an element, is there any way to simulate the typing of a string? ","Are you looking for a way to trigger the events associated with typing or do you want to append text to a container so that it looks like someone is typing? If you're looking for the events, then @Nick is absolutely correct in suggesting the methods for triggering the event. If the latter, you'll want to use a timer to replace the text/html of the container with successive substrings of your text. You might be able to get a better effect by appending successive span elements containing each letter if the text is very long -- this would reduce flashing as the text gets replaced and the layout changes momentarily. EDIT: I was going to add an example, but it turns out there's a plugin for that already: jTypeWriter. "

12,"I visited Avis.com, and I notice the web pages have *.ac extension. Not familiar with this type--what language or framework is this? This something Python-related? Thanks.

14,"I want to add tracking to our Flash-based media player so that we can provide analytics that show what sections of videos are being watched (at the moment, we just register a view when a video starts playing) For example, if a viewer watches the first 30 seconds of a video and then clicks away to something else, we want the data to reflect that. Likewise, if someone watches the first 10 seconds, then scrubs the timeline to the last minute of the video and watches that, we want to register viewing on the parts watched and not the middle section. My first thought was to collect up the viewing data in the player and send it all to the server at the end of a viewing session. Unfortunately, Flash does not seem to have an event that you can hook into when a viewer clicks away from the page the movie is on (probably a good thing - it would be open to abuse) So, it looks like we're going to have to make regular requests to the server as the video is playing. This is obviously going to lead to a high volume of requests when there are large numbers of simultaneous viewers. The simple approach of dumping all these 'heartbeat' events from clients to a database feels like it will quickly become unmanageable so I'm wondering whether I should be taking an approach where viewing sessions are cached in memory and flushed to database when they become inactive (based on a timeout). That way, the data could be stored as time spans rather than individual heartbeats. So, to the question - what is the best way to approach dealing with this kind of high-volume viewing data? Are there any good existing architectures/patterns? Thanks, Dan. ",Are you using Flash Media Server for streaming ? If yes the server can do all this things for you.

So in my mdb, I am first compacting and repairing, and then selecting create a new mde (just as I have done many times before). It looks like it is starting the process, but never gets to where it compacts when it is done, and access is not responding. So after I force close the app, I look in the folder where I am trying to create the MDE to and I see there is a new access db1 file there. If I try to open that it gives me an error that says file not found, and then it says the Visual Basic for Applications is corrupt. The thing is, I just made a very simple adjustment to the code since last launching an mde, and after this I double and triple checked it...its not that because its just a simple open this form and close this one addition.

16,mysql_pconnect as I read does not close when the mysql_query ceases.. in that case why do we use this command?? does that create any security issue?? ,"First of all, it's worth noting that persistent connections are not MySQL-specific. What's their purpose? They allow to reuse a database connection in different script calls. Otherwise, scripts must open new connections every time they're executed. This is particularly useful when opening a new connection is an expensive operation. In my personal experience, they should be avoided when coding with PHP and MySQL for these reasons: PHP does a very poor handling of the connection pool and you're likely to have a hundred idle connections that are not being reused. MySQL allows to open new connections pretty quickly compared to other DBMS. I'm not sure about what security issues you have in mind. In order to reuse an idle connection, your PHP script needs to provide the same credentials that were used to open it. If script A opens a connection as root, script B cannot use it with other user.

","A properly non-ASCII-centric implementation: private static String allLetters(String charsetName) { CharsetEncoder ce = Charset.forName(charsetName).newEncoder(); StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(); for(char c=0; c&lt;Character.MAX_VALUE; c++) { if(ce.canEncode(c) &amp;&amp; Character.isLetter(c)) { result.append(c); } } return result.toString(); } Call this with ""US-ASCII"" and you'll get the desired result (except that uppercase letters come first). You could call it with Charset.defaultCharset(), but I suspect that you'd get far more than the ASCII letters on most systems, even in the USA. Caveat: only considers the basic multilingual plane. Wouldn't be too hard to extend to the supplementary planes, but it would take a lot longer, and the utility is questionable. "

There are at least three ""more obvious"" approaches to the problem. a) Content-type: application/octet-stream; charset=utf-8 + filename=&lt;utf8 byte sequence&gt; e.g. filename=Москва.txt This is a violation of standards but firefox shows the name correctly. IE doesn't. b) Content-type: application/octet-stream; charset=utf-8 + filename=&lt;urlencode(utf8 byte sequence)&gt; e.g. filename=%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B0.txt This works with IE but not with firefox. c) providing the name as specified in rfc 2231 e.g filename*=UTF-8''%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B0.txt Again firefox supports this, IE doesn't. for a more comprehensive comparison see http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/ edit: When I said that there is no single solution, I meant via header('...'). But there is something of a work around. When there is no usable filename=xyz header browsers use the basename of the path part of the url. I.e. for &lt;a href=""test.php/lala.txt""&gt; both firefox and IE suggest lalala.txt as the filename. You can append extra path components after the actual path to your php script (when using apache's httpd see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.1/mod/core.html#acceptpathinfo). E.g. if you have a file test.php in your document root and request it as http://localhost/test.php/x/y/z the variable $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'] will contain /x/y/z. Now, if you put a link like &lt;a href=""/test.php/download/moskwa/&amp;#x41c;&amp;#x43e;&amp;#x441;&amp;#x43a;&amp;#x432;&amp;#x430;"" &gt; &amp;#x41c;&amp;#x43e;&amp;#x441;&amp;#x43a;&amp;#x432;&amp;#x430; &lt;/a&gt; in your document you can fetch the download/moskwa/... part and initiate the download of the file. Without sending any filename=... information both firefox and IE suggest the ""right"" name. You can even combine it with sending the name according to rfc 2231. That's why I also put moskwa into the link. That would be the id the script uses to find the file it is supposed to send. The IE ignores the filename*=... information and still uses the basename part of the url to suggest a name. That means for firefox (and any other client that supports rfc 2231) the part after the id is meaningless* but for the IE (and other clients not supporting rfc 2231) it would be used for the name suggestion. self-contained example: &lt;?php // test.php $files = array( 'moskwa'=&gt;array( 'htmlentities'=&gt;'&amp;#x41c;&amp;#x43e;&amp;#x441;&amp;#x43a;&amp;#x432;&amp;#x430;', 'content'=&gt;'55° 45′ N, 37° 37′ O' ), 'athen'=&gt;array( 'htmlentities'=&gt;'&amp;#x391;&amp;#x3b8;&amp;#x3ae;&amp;#x3bd;&amp;#x3b1;', 'content'=&gt;'37° 59′ N, 23° 44′ O' ) ); $fileid = null; if ( isset($_SERVER['PATH_INFO']) &amp;&amp; preg_match('!^/download/([^/]+)!', $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'], $m) ) { $fileid = $m[1]; } if ( is_null($fileid) ) { foreach($files as $fileid=&gt;$bar) { printf( '&lt;a href=""./test.php/download/%s/%s.txt""&gt;%s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;', $fileid, $bar['htmlentities'], $bar['htmlentities'] ); } } else if ( !isset($files[$fileid]) ) { echo 'no such file'; } else { $f = $files[$fileid]; $utf8name = mb_convert_encoding($f['htmlentities'], 'utf-8', 'HTML-ENTITIES'); $utf8name = urlencode($utf8name); header(""Content-type: text/plain""); header(""Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*=UTF-8''$utf8name.txt""); header(""Content-length: "" . strlen($f['content'])); echo $f['content']; } *) That's a bit like here on Stack Overflow.

Why can't my custom exception class derive from 'ApplicationException' or 'SecurityException' or the base 'Exception' class? I am of the impression that I should derive from the base Exception class and not the previous two. My question second is, when would you derive from the other two??? Are there any clear-cut distinctions as to when you would derive from either one of these three? Assuming there are no others I have I have missed out?

Why is the unsigned value of -1 not considered here? ","It looks like your pointer is overflowing. Let's do some maths. Say you're on a 32-bit machine, and your pointer is initialised to 0x 12 34 56 78. We then initialise an unsigned int variable to -1, which is 0x FF FF FF FF. Because it's an unsigned integer, the -1 is overflowing and actually represents 4 294 967 295. Your pointer is to an integer (int*), so each increment actually increments the address by sizeof int, which is 4 on a standard x86 machine. So we're actually adding 0x 03 FF FF FF FC (which is 0x FF FF FF FF * 4). Now let's add the two together. 0x 00 12 34 56 78 + 0x 03 FF FF FF FC ------------------- 0x 04 12 34 56 74 Of course, this overflows, because we now have a 40-bit value, and a pointer is 32 bits and can only hold that much information.

How do I dynamically traverse the categories structure? &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt; &lt;catalog&gt; &lt;category name=""Category - level 1""&gt; &lt;category name=""Category - level 2"" /&gt; &lt;category name=""Category - level 2""&gt; &lt;category name=""Category - level 3"" /&gt; &lt;/category&gt; &lt;category name=""Category - level 2""&gt; &lt;category name=""Category - level 3""&gt; &lt;category name=""Category - level 4"" /&gt; &lt;/category&gt; &lt;/category&gt; &lt;/category&gt; &lt;/catalog&gt; What I have now: I have no problem looping through XML files with a set structure: &lt;catalog&gt; &lt;category name=""Category - level 1""&gt; &lt;category name=""Category - level 2""&gt; &lt;category name=""Category - level 3"" /&gt; &lt;/category&gt; &lt;category name=""Category - level 2""&gt; &lt;category name=""Category - level 3"" /&gt; &lt;/category&gt; &lt;/category&gt; &lt;/catalog&gt; Coding example: //$xml holds the XML file foreach ( $xml AS $category_level1 ) { echo $category_level1['name']; foreach ( $category_level1-&gt;category AS $category_level2 ) { echo $category_level2['name']; foreach ( $category_level2-&gt;category AS $category_level3 ) { echo $category_level3['name']; } } } ","Getting the name attributes from your categories is likely fastest when done via XPath, e.g. $categoryNames = $doc-&gt;xpath('//category/@name'); However, if you want to recursively iterate over an arbitrary nested XML structure, you can also use the SimpleXMLIterator, e.g. with $xml being the string you gave: $sxi = new RecursiveIteratorIterator( new SimpleXMLIterator($xml), RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST); foreach($sxi as $node) { echo str_repeat(""\t"", $sxi-&gt;getDepth()), // indenting $node['name'], // getting attribute name PHP_EOL; // line break } will give Category - level 1 Category - level 2 Category - level 2 Category - level 3 Category - level 2 Category - level 3 Category - level 4 Like said in the beginning, when just wanting to get all name attributes, use XPath, because iterating over each and every node is slow. Use this approach only when you want to do more complex things with the nodes, for instance adding something to them. "
54,"on my 32-bit machine (with an Intel T7700 duo core), I have 15 precision digits for both double and long double types for the C language. I compared the parameters LDBL_DIG for long double and DBL_DIG for double and they are both 15. I got these answers using MVS2008. I was wondering if these results can be compiler dependent or do they just depend on my processor? Thanks a lot... ",Some compilers support a long double format that has more precision than double. Microsoft MSVC isn't one of them. If 15 significant digits isn't good enough then the odds are very high that you shouldn't be using a floating point type in the first place. Check this thread for arbitrary precision libraries.

56,"I am having some difficulty creating a bundle for my application, and placing files in the bundle. For example, Facebook has developed a bundle for iPhone applications using their framework. In the same way, I also want to create a bundle which can be reused for many applications. My questions are: what steps should I follow to create a bundle for any kind of application? what should be taken care while creating a bundle? ","First of all, since your question is tagged iPhone, you can only include code in your bundles on the iPhone. So basically you can only use bundles to package up pictures and sound files and other static data. When you create a new project in XCode, there is an option to make the target a bundle (under Framework &amp; Library), but an assets bundle is just a directory with a .bundle suffix. I generate mine with this little script: #!/bin/bash echo ""Building assets bundle."" if [ -d ./MyAssets.bundle ]; then rm ./MyAssets.bundle/* else mkdir ./MyAssets.bundle fi find ./assets -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -J% cp % ./MyAssets.bundle (I'm no bash hacker, so this can probably be improved in countless ways. Suggestions welcome!) This takes a folder hierarchy and flattens it (I detest hierarchies) into a single directory which is named MyAssets.bundle. I trigger this script from a separate build phase when in projects that import the bundle, so that changes are automatically tracked. If you want to learn how to create framework bundles, it's a bit more complicated (you have to follow certain conventions and include info in plists), but for iPhone bundles, this is pretty much all you will need to know and do.

I could ""hide"" certain directories containing sensitive parts of the code from the developer, so that he wouldn't be able to see their contents, nor commit any changes to them.

This may be related with you gitconfig file, as described in this thread The reason is that it appears rails-2.3.5/lib/commands/plugin.rb is trying use git pull to grab the plugin code (see the install_using_git method), which doesn't work right. Example: script/plugin install git://github.com/fesplugas/typus.git mkdir vendor/plugins/typus cd vendor/plugins/typus git init git pull --depth 1 git://github.com/fesplugas/typus.git That last line exits 1, but that error is being masked by the install_using_git method, and the directory is just rm -rf'ed. I tracked this down to a conflict with ~/.gitconfig. If I remove these lines it works: [branch ""master""] remote = origin merge = refs/heads/master It appears a naked git pull has problems with these settings. Actually, the problem would be here because of a global git config file (in your homedir: '~/.gitconfig'), defining a master which may be incompatible with the master expected by the git pull within that specific Git repo.

64,"I am learning JPA from this tutorial. I have some confusions in understanding the following annotations: @Basic @Embedded Fields of an embeddable type default to persistent, as if annotated with @Embedded. If the fields of embeddable types default to persistent, then why would we need the @Embedded annotation ","The @Embeddable annotation allows to specify a class whose instances are stored as intrinsic part of the owning entity. This annotation has no attributes. @Embeddable public class EmploymentPeriod { java.util.Date startDate; java.util.Date endDate; ... } The @Embedded annotation is used to specify a persistent field or property of an entity whose value is an instance of an embeddable class. By default, column definitions specified in the @Embeddable class apply to the table of the owning entity but you can override them using@AttributeOverride: @Embedded @AttributeOverrides({ @AttributeOverride(name=""startDate"", column=@Column(name=""EMP_START"")), @AttributeOverride(name=""endDate"", column=@Column(name=""EMP_END"")) }) public EmploymentPeriod getEmploymentPeriod() { ... } Regarding the optional @Basic annotation, you may use it to configure the fetch type to LAZY and to configure the mapping to forbid null values (for non primitive types) with the optional attribute. @Basic(fetch=LAZY) protected String getName() { return name; } You can also place it on a field or property to explicitly mark it as persistent (for documentation purpose).

65,"Could anyone point exactly where MSDN says thet every user stored procedure returns 0 by default if no error happens? In other words, could I be sure that example code given below when being a stored procedure IF someStatement BEGIN RETURN 1 END should always return zero if someStatement is false and no error occurs? I know that it actually works this way, but I failed to find any explicit statement about this from Microsoft. ","It looks like once upon a time the return value may have meant something (see reference of pre SQL 2000 BOL return value article) prior to SQL Server 2000. I checked around to see if I could find a listing of these original return codes specifically for MS SQL, and found the following (I don't know its authenticity though, and it doesn't actually list the values). So, after reading all of these articles it looks like @return_status is a parameter that is ALWAYS returned when a stored procedure is executed (even if you do not use it). According to the RETURN Books online article the return code CANNOT be null. When used with a stored procedure, RETURN cannot return a null value. If a procedure tries to return a null value (for example, using RETURN @status when @status is NULL), a warning message is generated and a value of 0 is returned. Running the following T-SQL definitely shows this, create Procedure Test as begin DECLARE @RTN integer Return @RTN END GO Exec Test GO Drop Procedure Test GO You'll receive The 'Test' procedure attempted to return a status of NULL, which is not allowed. A status of 0 will be returned instead. In the end it looks like the answer is because @return_status cannot be null (being 0 when not set, or set to NULL)... As for the error codes mentioned in the supposed BOL article for SQL 7.0, my guess would be an old hold over from Sybase... Sybase 5.0 Manual Kris "

Though there are nuances here and there, MVC frameworks share a lot of the same principles, so whichever you choose to use is really a matter of which you most enjoy using. So, if you like Python more, there's your answer. Use a Python framework, and Django is the best. If you like PHP more (which I personally don't), you've got some more decisions to make. But any of the PHP frameworks are fine. They really are. Just pick one that looks nice with comprehensive documentation and get to work. "

It sounds like you do not actually want to change the textField, but instead want to change another, related control that identifies the card type. You can use the algorithm described in Determine Credit Card Type By Number as a helper function to adjust credit card type accordingly when the user begins typing. You may want to skip the full verification until the input string has the correct number of characters. Update: an interesting response in the same thread mentions that actually letting the user pick credit card type is a good idea because it at least shows the user the list of credit cards you accept.

81,"I have a dilema, I want to present to the user a semi-transparent view. I found out by experimenting that if I simply pushed the transparent view to the top of my NavigationController's stack, that it would not render the transparency level I wanted. So I decided to simply add the view as a subview of the current view at the top of the stack. This solution works, the view below is still visible, and the View is 'semi-modal'. The problem is, if the parent view inherits from UITableViewController (as mine does), then the view I 'push' onto it, does not cover the navigation bar at the top. I really don't want to get into a situation where I am forced to enable / disable controls on the navigation bar every time I push this view, so I was wondering, if anyone knew of any solutions that I could use so that the view I push onto the UITableViewController will actually 'push over' the navigation bar? ","Funny, I was just doing the same thing yesterday. Unfortunately it seems to be impossible. Once the modal view controller is in place, the previous view becomes hidden. See this previous question on the topic. You can still use the view controller and NIB files you have set up - here's my sample code - (void)showUpgrade { [self.upgradeVC viewWillAppear:NO]; [self.view addSubview:self.upgradeVC.view]; [self.upgradeVC viewDidAppear:NO]; } - (void)hideUpgrade { [self.upgradeVC viewWillDisappear:NO]; [self.upgradeVC.view removeFromSuperview]; [self.upgradeVC viewDidDisappear:NO]; } - (UpgradeViewController *)upgradeVC { if (_upgradeVC == nil) { _upgradeVC = [[UpgradeViewController alloc] initWithNibName:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""UpgradeView_%@"", self.deviceType] bundle:nil]; _upgradeVC.delegate = self; } return _upgradeVC; } You will need to store a reference to the parent view controller in the modal view controller so that you can access the -hide method. I did this through a delegate. It would also be easy to add some animation to -show and -hide if you want it to animate up from the bottom of the screen - I was just too lazy to do this. "
82,"I have a StatusChanged event that is raised by my object when its status changes - however, the application needs to carry out additional actions based on what the new status is. e.g If the new status is Disconnected, then it must update the status bar text and send an email notification. So, I wanted to create an Enum with the possible statuses (Connected, Disconnected, ReceivingData, SendingData etc.) and have that sent with the EventArgs parameter of the event when it is raised (see below) Define the object: class ModemComm { public event CommanderEventHandler ModemCommEvent; public delegate void CommanderEventHandler(object source, ModemCommEventArgs e); public void Connect() { ModemCommEvent(this, new ModemCommEventArgs ModemCommEventArgs.eModemCommEvent.Connected)); } } Define the new EventArgs parameter: public class ModemCommEventArgs : EventArgs{ public enum eModemCommEvent { Idle, Connected, Disconnected, SendingData, ReceivingData } public eModemCommEvent eventType { get; set; } public string eventMessage { get; set; } public ModemCommEventArgs(eModemCommEvent eventType, string eventMessage) { this.eventMessage = eventMessage; this.eventType = eventType; } } I then create a handler for the event in the application: ModemComm comm = new ModemComm(); comm.ModemCommEvent += OnModemCommEvent; and private void OnModemCommEvent(object source, ModemCommEventArgs e) { } The problem is, I get a 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object' error when the object attempts to raise the event. Hoping someone can explain in n00b terms why and how to fix it :) ","Events are null when no clients are subscribed to them, so an attempt to invoke an event that has no subscribers will fail with a NullReferenceException. Some common techniques to avoid this: 1) Check for null in a thread-safe manner (from the event raiser's perspective; there is still a race condition on the client, however it's their responsibility to be handle that) var handler = this.ModemCommEvent; if( handler != null ) { handler(this, new ModemCommEventArgs( ModemCommEventArgs.eModemCommEvent.Connected )); } The above code is the more complex version of this: if( this.ModemCommEvent != null ) { this.ModemCommEvent(this, new ModemCommEventArgs(ModemCommEventArgs.eModemCommEvent.Connected)); } The first one (that creates a local variable) is safer from the event raiser's perspective because the local variable will either be null or it won't and nothing will change that. In the second one, however, a client running on a separate thread could unsubscribe from the event between the time your check for null is done and you raise the event. In that case, you'd end up with a NullReferenceException again. If neither you nor your code's clients are executing on multiple threads (no BackgroundWorker, Thread object, asynchronous invoke, etc), then the safer check is redundant. If you're not sure, however, it's a good practice to get into. That, or do #2. 2) Default your event to an empty value public event CommanderEventHandler ModemCommEvent = delegate { }; This side-steps the issue completely by always having at least one subscriber. The ""delegate {}"" syntax creates an anonymous method that does nothing that is the ""default subscriber"" to the event. No matter how many clients subscribe or unsubscribe from your event, this anonymous method will always be there, preventing your event from being null. -- This has been discussed ad nauseum all over the internet. Here is one such example: C# Events and Thread Safety "

89,"I've started working on a little ruby project that will have sample implementations of a number of different data structures and algorithms. Right now it's just for me to refresh on stuff I haven't done for a while, but I'm hoping to have it set up kind of like Ruby Koans, with a bunch of unit tests written for the data structures but the implementations empty (with full implementations in another branch). It could then be used as a nice learning tool or code kata. However, I'm having trouble coming up with a good way to write the tests. I can't just test the public behavior as that won't necessarily tell me about the implementation, and that's kind of important here. For example, the public interfaces of a normal BST and a Red-Black tree would be the same, but the RB Tree has very specific data organization requirements. How would I test that? ","Not sure what you are up to, but if you want to provide common interfaces for various data structures which can then be implemented and/or specialized further in various ways, I don't see how you could write tests for any concrete implementation which does not yet exist. You can write tests for the common interface to ensure that all implementations fulfill the contract specified by that interface. E.g. all implementations of a sorted tree should order their elements properly etc. As a side note, this wouldn't actually be a unit test but rather functionality / acceptance test. For red-black trees, you could write a suite of additional (optional) tests though, to verify that the tree is reordered properly after inserts &amp; deletes. This can and should be tested via the public interface nevertheless. E.g. add a series of elements to the tree in a way that would make the tree unbalanced without reordering, then check the tree structure to ensure that it got reordered properly. "

91,"I noticed that if you do a throw new InvalidCastException for example, the channel state on the client side is faulted. But if you throw new FaultException, the channel state on the client side is opened. By curiosity, what is the reason why one faults the channel and the other doesn't? ","The FaultException is a special case in WCF. It's meant to indicate that something happened on the service side that was an error, but at the same time, not fault the channel. This makes sense, given you can embed this information into the contract using the FaultContractAttribute to expose what can be expected from a contract. Other exceptions are not really translatable in the WS world. Exceptions are a technology-specific abstraction, and each technology stack has a different representation of that abstraction (or in some cases, none at all). That being said, when an exception that is not a fault exception is thrown on the server side, it is seen as catastrophic by the WCF runtime, and the channel must be faulted, as it is not known if you can proceed or not. However, using FaultException, it implies you have some foresight into the conditions around why it was thrown and whether or not the underlying channel has been impacted or not. "
92,"I have a ASP.NET Web Forms application and I'm using some dynamic controls in the view which depend on stuff that the presenter exposes. Is it okay for the view in this case to pull on the presenter for that data? Is there anything I should be extra careful about when considering testability and a loosely coupled design. The page in this case has it's own page-life cycle and the presenter doesn't know about this. However, the page-life cycle dictates that somethings must occur at specific moments in the page-life cycle. This smells like trouble... Any known pit falls? EDIT When my concrete view hits the Init event it will pull on the presenter for a collection that will result in a bunch of ASP.NET server controls to be created. I'm wondering if this is a particular bad thing to do... The presenter doesn't know how to respond to the page-life cycle init event but it has to if the view is to be populated with dynamic controls. ","This is a vexing question - when you want dynamic controls in ASP.NET web forms you've got to choose the lesser of two evils. Ultimately, it comes down to which compromise you want to make: presenter concerns in the view or view concerns in the presenter. When I work in web forms I usually prefer the latter - I accept that the presenter is tied to the ASP.NET page lifecycle and create an InitializeView method to do whatever's necessary to create dynamic controls: // Presenter // This could also be parameterless if you prefer that idiom but // then the view needs a SelectedState property that serves up values // straight from the Form collection, and it won't be obvious why. public void InitializeView(string selectedState) { if (selectedState != null) { view.Counties = dataLayer.GetCounties(selectedState); } } // View protected void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs args) { presenter.InitializeView(Request.Form[""StateList""]); // ... build counties drop-down ... } Of course, this ties the presenter's semantics to the ASP.NET lifecycle and obscures what's going on in that method. You can mitigate that by giving InitializeView a more descriptive name, like ProcessSelectedState, but unless the method name references the page lifecycle, it's never going to be obvious why you're not just getting counties with the rest of the model (in presenter.LoadModel or whatever you might call it). I can see how the alternative is attractive: protected void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs args) { if (Request.Form[""StateList""] != null) { List&lt;string&gt; counties = presenter.GetCounties(Request.Form[""StateList""]); // ... build counties drop-down ... } } The semantics of the Presenter are perfectly clear - it's easy to understand what GetCounties does and it doesn't have anything to do with the page lifecycle. But you have testable stuff in your view, which is a bummer, and that's usually more important to me than keeping my presenters ignorant of their view engine. Another alternative is to just load your entire model during page initialization. Your server control values won't be available, so you'd have to get any of those from Request.Form. That's not idiomatic ASP.NET classic though - it might be unduly confusing since most web forms developers are accustomed to getting values directly from web controls instead of directly from the POST data.

97,"I'm working with a device that sends back an image, and when I request an image, there is some undocumented information that comes before the image data. I was only able to realize this by looking through the binary data and identifying the image header information inside. I originally had a normal method and converted it to an extension method. The original question here was related to the compiler complaining about not having Array as the first parameter (I had Byte[]), but it turns out that I had made an error and forgot to delete the first argument in the calling code. In other words, I used to have: Byte[] new_buffer = RemoveUpToByteArray(buffer, new byte[] { 0x42, 0x4D }); and after changing to an extension method, I had erroneously used: buffer.RemoveUpToByteArray( buffer, new byte[] { 0x42, 0x4D }); Anyhow, that's all fixed now because I realized my mistake as I was entering the code example into SO. However, I have a new problem that is simply lack of understanding of extension methods and reference vs. value types. Here's the code: public static void RemoveFromByteArrayUntil(this Byte[] array, Byte[] until) { Debug.Assert(until.Count() &gt; 0); int num_header_bytes = until.Count(); int header_start_pos = 0; // the position of the header bytes, defined by [until] byte first_header_byte = until[0]; while(header_start_pos != -1) { header_start_pos = Array.IndexOf(array, first_header_byte, header_start_pos); if(header_start_pos == -1) break; // if we get here, then we've found the first header byte, and we need to look // for the next ones sequentially for(int header_ctr=1; header_ctr&lt;num_header_bytes; header_ctr++) { // we're going to loop over each of the header bytes, but will // bail out of this loop if there isn't a match if(array[header_start_pos + header_ctr] != until[header_ctr]) { // no match, so bail out. but before doing that, advance // header_start_pos so the outer loop won't find the same // occurrence of the first header byte over and over again header_start_pos++; break; } } // if we get here, we've found the header! // create a new byte array of the new size int new_size = array.Count() - header_start_pos; byte[] output_array = new byte[new_size]; Array.Copy(array, header_start_pos, output_array, 0, new_size); // here is my problem -- I want to change what array points to, but // when this code returns, array goes back to its original value, which // leads me to believe that the first argument is passed by value. array = output_array; return; } // if we get here, we didn't find a header, so throw an exception throw new HeaderNotInByteArrayException(); } My problem now is that it looks like the first this argument to the extension method is passed by value. I want to reassign what array points to, but in this case, it looks like I'll have to just manipulate array's data instead. ","Extension methods are static methods that only appear to be instance methods. You can consider the instance the extension method is working on to be read only (by value). Assigning to the instance method of byte[] that is the first parameter of your extension won't work. You won't be able to get away from assigning, but you could modify your extension then write your assignment like this: buffer = buffer.RemoveUpToByteArray(header); Make your extension return the byte array result, and don't try to assign to buffer within the extension. Your extension would then be something like this: public static class MyExtensionMethods { public static byte[] RemoveUpToByteArray(this byte[] buffer, byte[] header) { byte[] result = buffer; // your logic to remove header from result return result; } } I hope this helps. EDIT: The above is correct for value types only. If the type you are extending is a reference type, then you would not have an issue operating directly on the type like you are trying to do above. Sadly, a byte array is a struct, and thus derived from System.ValueType. Consider the following, which would be perfectly legal inside an extension, and would give the desired result: public class MyBytes { public byte[] ByteArray { get; set; } } public static class MyExtensionMethods { // Notice the void return here... public static void MyClassExtension(this MyBytes buffer, byte[] header) { buffer.ByteArray = header; } } "

I'm a believer in Convention over Configuration and therefor my views are in jsp/product/ folder and are called create.jsp , list.jsp and show.jsp this works relatively well until I add the @PathVariable attribute. When I hit root/product/show/1 I get the following error: ../jsp/product/show/1.jsp"" not found how do I tell this method to use the show.jsp view ? If I don't add the RequestMapping on class level my show method will be mapped to root/show instead of root/owner/show how do I solve this ? I'd like to avoid using the class level RequestMapping. ","Check out the section in the manual about ""Supported handler method arguments and return types"". Basically, when your @RequestMapping method returns just an object, then Spring uses this as a single model attribute, and, I'm guessing, attempts to use the request URL as the basis for the view name. The easiest way to return the view and data you want from the same method is probably to just have the method return a ModelAndView, so you can explicitly specify the viewName and the model data. "

103,"[Authorize] attribute is nice and handy MS invention, and I hope it can solve the issues I have now To be more specific: When current client isn't authenticated - [Authorize] redirects from secured action to logon page and after logon was successful - brings user back, this is good. But when current client already authenticated but not authorized to run specific action - all I need is to just display my general 403 page. Is it possible without moving authorization logic within controller's body? Update: The behavior I need in should be semantically equals to this sketch: public ActionResult DoWork() { if (!NotAuthorized()) { // this should be not redirect, but forwarding return RedirectToAction(""403""); } return View(); } so - there should no any redirect and url should be stay the same, but contents of the page should be replaced with 403-page Update 2: I implemented sketch in this way: [HandleError] public class HomeController : Controller { public ActionResult Index() { ViewData[""Message""] = ""Welcome to ASP.NET MVC!""; return View(); } [CustomActionFilter] public ActionResult About() { return View(); } public ActionResult Error_403() { return Content(""403""); } } public class CustomActionFilter : ActionFilterAttribute { public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext) { filterContext.Result = new ContentResult { Content = ""403"" }; } } And can't get how to properly forward execution to HomeController.Action_403() so it display 403. Update 3: filterContext.Result = new ViewResult() { ViewName = ""Error_403"" }; so this is an answer on how to render specific view template... but still have no idea how to run another controller - anyway, it's enough good solution. ","You should be able to create your own class that derives from AuthorizeAttribute and override the AuthorizeCore method to provide the authorization mechanism that you want, so that you can apply your custom authorization code by using an attribute instead of moving it into the controller. If you need more fine-grained control over authorization, then I recommend that you create an implementation of the IActionFilter interface (on an attribute, then apply the attribute to your methods). This will allow you to intercept calls before they go to the controller, and provide alternate actions before your controller method is called. This is achieved by implementing the OnActionExecuting method on the IActionFilter interface. If your logic determines that you should not make the call to the controller at all, and you want to provide an ActionResult to be processed instead, then you would set the Result property on the ActionExecutingContext instance passed into the method. By doing this, that ActionResult is processed instead of going to the controller method to get an ActionResult. If you want to return a 403 error code, then you can't use the ContentResult class. You will have to create your own class that derives from ActionResult and override the ExecuteResult method to set the StatusCode property on the HttpResponseBase to 403, like so: internal class Http403Result : ActionResult { public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context) { // Set the response code to 403. context.HttpContext.Response.StatusCode = 403; } } public class CustomActionFilter : ActionFilterAttribute { public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext) { filterContext.Result = new Http403Result(); } } Of course, you can generalize the Http403Result class to take a constructor which will accept the status code that you want to return, but the concept remains the same.

","MSBuild (which VS uses to do builds, from 2005/.NET2) supports parallel builds. By default VS will set the maximum degree of parallelism to your number of processors. Use Tools | Options | Projects and Solutions | Build and Run to override this default. Of course any one build might have more limited (or no) capacity to allow parallel builds. E.g. only one assembly in a solution provides no scope to build in parallel. Equally a large number of assemblies with lots of dependencies might block parallelism (A depends on B, C depends on A&amp;B, D depends on C has no scope for parallel builds).

114,"How can I merge two wav files using java? I tried this but it didn't work correctly, is their any other way to do it? ","If you work with the bytes of a wav file directly you can use the same strategy in any programming language. For this example I'll assume the two source files have the same bitrate/numchannels and are the same length/size. (if not you can probably edit them before starting the merge). First look over the wav specificaiton, I found a good one at a stanford course website: Common header lengths are 44 or 46 bytes. If you want to concatenate two files (ie play one wav then the other in a single file): find out what format your wav files are chop off the first 44/46 bytes which are the headers, the remainder of the file is the data create a new file and stick one of the headers in that. new wav file = {header} = {44/46} bytes long add the two data parts from the original files new wav file = {header + data1 + data2 } = {44/46 + size(data1) + size(data2)} bytes long modify your header in two places to reflect the new file's length. a. modify bytes 4+4 (ie. 4 bytes starting at offset 4). The new value should be a hexadecimal number representing the size of the new wav file in bytes {44/46 + size(data1) + size(data2)} - 8bytes. b. modify bytes 40+4 or 42+4 (the 4 bytes starting at offset 40 or 42, depending on if you have a 44byte header or 46 byte header). The new value should be a hexadecimal number representing the total size of the new wav file. ie {44/46 + size(data1) + size(data2)} If you want to instead merge or mix the two files (so that they both play at the same time then): you won't have to edit the header if both files are the same length. starting at byte 44/46 you will have to edit each sample to be the value in data1 + the value in data2. so for example if your SampleRate was 8 bits you would modify 1 byte, if your sample rate was 16bits you would modify 2 bytes. the rest of the file is just Samples of 1/2bytes storing an int value representing the waveform of the sound at that time. a. For each of the remaining samples in the file grab the 1/2 byte hex string and get the int value from both files data1 and data2. b. add the 1/2 byte integers together convert the result back to hexadecimal and use that value in your output file. c. You normally have to divide that number by 2 to get an average value that fits back in the original 1/2byte sample block. I was getting distortion when i tried it in objc(probably related to signed or unsigned ints) and just skipped the division part since it will only likely be a problem if you are merging very loud sounds together. ie when data1 + data2 is larger than 1/2 bytes the sound will clip. There was a discussion about the clipping issue here and you may want to try one of those clipping techniques. "

118,"I would like to create/use a system-wide independent universal 'counter object' that can be called via COM in a thread-safe manner. The counter object will be passed an ID to identify which counter to return, handle the counting, 'persist' the count (occasionally), have reasonable performance (as fast as possible) perhaps capable of 1000 counts per second or better (1mS) and be accessible cross-process/out-of-process. The current count status must be persisted between object restarts/shutdowns. The counter object is liklely to be a 'singleton' type object implemented in some form of free-threaded dictionary, containing maybe 10 counters (perhaps 50 max). The count needs to be monotonic and consistent, (ie: guaranteed unique sequential values). Each counter should have a few methods, like reset, inc, dec, set, clear, remove. As a luxury, I would like to have a variable-increment (ie: 'step by' value). To support thread-safefty, perhaps some sorm of critical-section or mutex call. It just needs to return a long/4byte signed integer. I really want something that can be called from anywhere, including VBScript, so I figure COM is my preferred solution.

I know you will say that disc-space is cheap, but for my application the cost is in slow inserts, and guids don't help (and I have tried/tested) but would prefer not to use if I have a choice. Autonumber/autoincs are evil: a) don't get the value until after the insert, b) session specific, c) easy to lose/screw up on a table alter, d) no good for mutli-table inserts, (its not MS-SQL Svr) plus I have a need for counters outside my DB... ","By the sound of it, what you're looking to create is an ActiveX EXE.

121,"In Chapter 16 of ""The Seasoned Schemer"", the authors define a recursive procedure ""depth"", which returns 'pizza nested in n lists, e.g (depth 3) is (((pizza))).

E.g. If I've already computed (depthM 8), when I later compute (depthM 9), I just lookup the return value of (depthM 8) and cons it onto null, instead of recursing all the way down to (depthM 0). But then they move the Ns and Rs inside the procedure, and initialize them to null with ""let"". Why doesn't this completely defeat the point of caching the return values? From a bit of experimentation, it appears that the Ns and Rs are being reinitialized on every call to ""depthM"". Am I misunderstanding their point? I guess my question is really this: Is there a way in Scheme to have lexically-scoped variables preserve their values in between calls to a procedure, like you can do in Perl 5.10 with ""state"" variables? ","Duh. Not having read the Seasoned Schemer, I cannot comment on the memoization issue, unless you give some source code here. However, regarding the question of whether there is a way to have lexically scoped variables keep their state between function calls... This is a feature of the Scheme language called ""closures"". Consider the following example: (define counter (let ((number 0)) (lambda () (let ((result number)) (set! number (+ number 1)) result))) This piece of code defines a function called counter, which uses a lexical variable (number) to keep track of its state. Each time you call the function, you will get a different number in return: &gt; (counter) 0 &gt; (counter) 1 and so on. The important point here is, that the function generated by the execution of the lambda expression ""closes over"" all lexically visible variables from enclosing scopes (in this case only number.) This means, that those variables remain valid places to read values from or write new values to. "

131,"I'm implementing a CORBA like server. Each class has remotely callable methods and a dispatch method with two possible input, a string identifying the method or an integer which would be the index of the method in a table. A mapping of the string to the corresponding integer would be implemented by a map. The caller would send the string on the first call and get back the integer with the response so that it simply has to send the integer on subsequent calls. It is just a small optimization. The integer may be assigned dynamically on demand by the server object. The server class may be derived from another class with overridden virtual methods. What could be a simple and general way to define the method binding and the dispatch method ? Edit: The methods have all the same signature (no overloading). The methods have no parameters and return a boolean. They may be static, virtual or not, overriding a base class method or not. The binding must correctly handle method overriding. The string is class hierarchy bound. If we have A::foo() identified by the string ""A.foo"", and a class B inherits A and override the method A::foo(), it will still be identified as ""A.foo"", but the dispatcher will call A::foo if the server is an A object and B::foo if it is a B object. Edit (6 apr): In other words, I need to implement my own virtual method table (vftable) with a dynamic dispatch method using a string key to identify the method to call. The vftable should be shared among objects of the same class and behave as expected for polymorphism (inherited method override). Edit (28 apr): See my own answer below and the edit at the end.

Can this be done without using RewriteBase? ","When URLs are rewritten, the client doesn't know it. So when a client looks at a page at the URL ""example.com/some/url/"" and the page references an image in ""images/image.jpg"", the client looks for the image in ""example.com/some/url/images/image.jpg"" even though the page actually resides in ""example.com/some/other/url/"". That's the problem you're facing, right? There are three main solutions to this problem: Use absolute paths to resources instead of relative ones. Use the &lt;base&gt; tag to ensure that the client knows the root upon which to build its relative URLs is different from the page's apparent URL. Add a new rule for ""some/url/images/"" in your rewrite rules. Option 1 is probably the best idea, and you'll find that most sites that use URL rewriting use it, including Stack Overflow itself. Option 2 is frowned upon, but works and is relatively easy. Option 3 is the most difficult to maintain, as URL rewriting exceptions and special cases can appear as you're defining new rules. The most maintainable solution is to use absolute URLs. "

138,"My current setup: I have an entity object with some properties, among them an int Id. To communicate with the database, I've created a repository with, among others, the following method: public int Add(TEntity entity) { ObjectSet.AddObject(entity); return entity.Id; } (It's a generic repository, that requires that TEntity is a class, and that it implements IEntity, which is just an interface with an int Id property.) My problem: Now, when I want to create a new entity for adding to the repository, I need to give it an id. However, that doesn't allow EF to automatically generate the id for me, since it will already have a value. Possible solutions: I have only been able to think of these two possibilities. Make the Id property nullable Pass an EntryInputModel to the repository instead, and then do the mapping there. Currently I'm binding to EntryInputModel in my Controller, and mapping it to an Entry using AutoMapper. If I need to change this, I also need to re-think the dependencies in my project, since the ...InputModel and ...ViewModel classes are currently only available to my Web application. Which is preferable? Are there more ways to counter this? ","If you're using SQL Server as the backend, my recommended solution would be to make the ID column an INT IDENTITY on the database, and a not-nullable column in your entity object. When adding a new entity, assign the ID some arbitrary value, like -1 or something, or no value at all, even. The actual ID will be generated automatically by SQL Server when you insert the new entity ( EntityContext.AddToEntities(newEntity); EntityContext.SaveChanges(); and it will be automagically be signalled back to EF so you'll be able to use it right away once it's inserted: int newEntityID = newEntity.ID; Works like a charm - at least in my test apps :-) "

Any ideas on how to detect this issue and possible resolution will be of great help With Regards, Krishna ","I would suggest sending a Ctrl+Break to your app, dumping the threads and analysing the output. Perhaps your threads are waiting for some input (IO). Perhaps they're deadlocked. Perhaps they've exited with an uncaught exception. The thread dump will tell you what's going on (and it helps if you name your threads in advance so you can identify them in the dump). "

152,"I use InnovaStudio WYSIWYG Editor, and I am trying to replace InnovaStudio's Asset Manager with CKFinder. There's a line in the editor configuration for what URL to use for the asset manager. I have pointed it at CKFinder. The part I can't get to work is getting the field to populate with the double-clicked file's path from CKFinder. It appears to use the 'func' parameter to specify the callback function. The URL I'm calling is: /common/ckfinder/ckfinder.html?action=js&amp;func=setAssetValue The InnovaStudio WYSIWYG Editor provides the setAssetValue(v) callback function for setting the field value. The v parameter should hold the URL. CKFinder pops up as expected when it's invoked, but neither double-clicking the thumbnails nor using the ""select"" option in the context menu works. The normal/expected behavior is that CKFinder closes and the target field is populated with the URL for the selected asset. Additional Info: The InnovaStudio WYSIWYG Editor has a ""popup"" for adding an image or flash file to the content. This pop-up is in an iframe. When it calls CKFinder (or it's own asset manager), that is also in an iframe. It appears that CKFinder is looking in the scope of the main window rather than the image/flash iframe that actually contains the field that needs to be populated. ","(Sort of) Solution I discovered, by digging through the DOM with Firebug, that InnovaStudio creates an ISWindow object where it places references to the windows that it spawns. I modified my callback function to loop over that object and call the setAssetValue() function for the appropriate iframe. This worked, but CKEditor still did not close itself. I assume that's because it didn't ""know"" how to close the iframe that it was inside. Is there a way to tell CKFinder how to close the window it's inside of? I can envision other cases where using an iframe would be useful. I would prefer to have CKFinder to use the iframe display, but I finally got things working using the standard CKFinder popup.

I would start by looking at the source code for any of the cell widgets. They seem to take the resources as a constructor, however they also have constructors that use GWT.create(Resources.class) to create the resources if they are not provided. As far as your question about using this template for UIBinder, there are 3 options mentioned here. However you may run into chicken and the egg issues when trying to define the style inside the UIBinder. The issue you are running into with your other code is that your 2 different implementations of the style because uibinder creates it's own resource bundle which doesn't reference the parent's css. There are 3 solutions: 1) Tear the css out of the ui binder file into it's own file and use ui:with combined with either a provided field or uifactory to inject the style using your own resource bindle where you can compound the sources (i.e. @Source({DEFAULT_CSS, ""myCss.css""})). 2) Your other option is to look at the generated code and use the syntax they are using to refernce the css within the uibinder file, however there are 2 issues you will have to overcome: the chicken and the egg problem and the fact that google can change this without telling you and break your stuff. Here is an example of the generated client bundle from one of my files: @Source(""uibinder:com.foo.gwt.client.workspace.select.SelectWorkspaceViewImpl_SelectWorkspaceViewImplUiBinderImpl_GenCss_style.css"") SelectWorkspaceViewImpl_SelectWorkspaceViewImplUiBinderImpl_GenCss_style style(); 3) The last solution is to use deferred binding to replace the default style. &lt;replace-with class=""com.foo.gwt.laf.mpe.resource.CellTableResources""&gt; &lt;when-type-is class=""com.google.gwt.user.cellview.client.CellTable.Resources"" /&gt; &lt;when-property-is name=""laf"" value=""MPE"" /&gt; &lt;/replace-with&gt; "

","If you use a block cipher, you input must be an exact multiple of the block bit length. In order to encipher arbitrary length data, you need first to pad you data to a multiple of the block length. This can be done with any method, but there are a number of standards. PKCS7 is one which is quite common, you can see an overview on the wikipedia article on padding. Since block cipers operate on blocks, you also need to come up with a way of concatenating the encrypted blocks. This is very important, since naive techniques greatly reduce the strength of the encryption. There is also a wikipedia article on this. What you did was to try to encrypt (or decrypt) data of a length which didn't match the block length of the cipher, and you also explicitly asked for no padding and also no chaining mode of operation. Consequently the block cipher could not be applied to your data, and you got the reported exception. UPDATE: As a response to your update and GregS's remark, I would like to acknowledge that GregS was right (I did not know this about RSA), and elaborate a bit: RSA does not operate on bits, it operates on integer numbers. In order to use RSA you therefore need to convert your string message into an integer m: 0 &lt; m &lt; n, where n is the modulus of the two distinct primes chosen in the generation process. The size of a key in the RSA algorithm typically refers to n. More details on this can be found on the wikipedia article on RSA. The process of converting a string message to an integer, without loss (for instance truncating initial zeroes), the PKCS#1 standard is usually followed. This process also adds some other information for message integrity (a hash digest), semantical security (an IV) ed cetera. With this extra data, the maximum number of bytes which can be supplied to the RSA/None/PKCS1Padding is (keylength - 11). I do not know how PKCS#1 maps the input data to the output integer range, but my impression is that it can take any length input less than or equal to keylength - 11 and produce a valid integer for the RSA encryption. If you use no padding, your input will simply be interpreted as a number. Your example input, {0xbe, 0xef} will most probably be interpreted as {10111110 +o 11101111} = 1011111011101111_2 = 48879_10 = beef_16 (sic!). Since 0 &lt; beef_16 &lt; d46f473a2d746537de2056ae3092c451_16, your encryption will succeed. It should succeed with any number less than d46f473a2d746537de2056ae3092c451_16. This is mentioned in the bouncycastle FAQ. They also state the following: The RSA implementation that ships with Bouncy Castle only allows the encrypting of a single block of data. The RSA algorithm is not suited to streaming data and should not be used that way. In a situation like this you should encrypt the data using a randomly generated key and a symmetric cipher, after that you should encrypt the randomly generated key using RSA, and then send the encrypted data and the encrypted random key to the other end where they can reverse the process (ie. decrypt the random key using their RSA private key and then decrypt the data).

The settings currently needed to be configured include Host Settings, Portal Settings and User Profile Definitions.

Often it is recommended to use APIs with many frameworks. 2) Create a Configuration module and implement IUpgradeable.UpgradeModule and programatically set the settings? 3) Create a PortalTemplate from a portal with the settings all set.

Either option #2 or #3 seem pretty reasonable - although you may want to decide based on what your deployment plan looks like. Would you be using a site template anyway? Are you deploying packaged modules only? Are you performing manual deployment steps? You may want to weigh options #2 or #3 based on the answers to those questions.

177,"I’m starting to develop my first full-blown Cocoa application containing a view which I would like to behave (and look) similar to Automator’s AMWorkflowView. The basic features I’d like to achieve: Positioning of subviews Display of subviews in expanded / collapsed states Multiple selection Drag and drop In order to get accustomed to Cocoa, I started with a custom NSView which mainly served as a container for the custom subviews and handled their positioning and multiple selection. The subviews are also subclasses of NSView, and contain a variable amount of views themselves, like buttons, labels and popup menus, and therefore can have different heights. This worked quite well, but before going on, I want to make sure to have everything neat and tidy according to the MVC pattern. I suspect that there already is a class in Cocoa that facilitates the implementation of a view container, like maybe NSCollectionView. It seems that there is no (easy) way to display differently sized views in an NSCollectionView, though. Should I continue implementing my custom NSView (probably using an NSArrayController for selection and sorting support), or are there better ways to go? Any help is much appreciated ","Unfortunately the answer is you'll have to roll your own. NSCollectionView does not allow for variable-sized items (which also rules out expanded/collapsed states). For a limited number of items, you can accomplish this rather easily (you just need a container view that arranges the subviews properly when asked to layout, then you need to make sure you re-layout when things change). For many subviews, however, you'll need to take care to be as efficient as possible. This can start with laying out as little as possible (only those ""after"" the resized view, for example) and get as complex as caching a visual representation of a prototype view, drawing the cached images (fast!) for all but the view being edited, and only using/positioning a ""real"" view for the view being edited. Drag and drop works the same as it always has, but none of the above accounts for the pretty animation NSCollectionView gives you. :-) It's fast and beautifully-animated precisely because all the subviews are uniform (so the layout calculations are fast and simple). Once you add irregular sizes, the problem becomes significantly more complicated. The bottom line: If you need variably-sized views, NSCollectionView will not work and you'll need to roll your own or find someone else's shared code, but performance and beautiful animation will not be easy.

Thanks ,"An enum is guaranteed to be represented by an integer, but the actual type (and its signedness) is implementation-dependent. You can force an enumeration to be represented by a signed type by giving one of the enumerators a negative value: enum SignedEnum { a = -1 }; In C++0x, the underlying type of an enumeration can be explicitly specified: enum ShortEnum : short { a }; (C++0x also adds support for scoped enumerations) For completeness, I'll add that in The C Programming Language, 2nd ed., enumerators are specified as having type int (p. 215).

The embedded device then starts streaming data via upd. Once you've received the data you send a message down a second upd socket to say ""I got that one"". The device then starts streaming the next bit of data (again via upd). This then continues ad infinitum. I've seen variations where the initial TCP connection is skipped and device just constantly stream data. Request/Response How many sockets you'll need here depends on who's making the initial connection, as that'll determine who needs the listening socket. Since you're making the initial connection, I'll use that. This is the more connection oriented scenario. Here you make a connection to the device and request some data, the device then sends you the response to that data. In this scenarioyou can only use one socket. As the device will respond to each request on the socket it was received. So to answer you question ""What makes more sense?"", it completely depends on the design of your embedded device. If it's responding on the same socket as you're requesting, the answer is simple as only one socket is possible. Streaming devices via upd should give better performance with two sockets, but again only if your device supports it. As for the second part of your question, ""to receive data as fast as possible."", that's easy go asynchronous. Here are some excellent blogs on asynchronous socket programming: .NET Sockets - Two Way - Single Client (C# Source Code - Included) .NET Sockets in Two Directions with Multiple Client Support (C# Source Code Included) If you're using a custom/third party protocol to communicate with the device you can't go wrong having a read through these either: How to Transfer Fixed Sized Data With Async Sockets Part 2: How to Transfer Variable Length Messages With Async Sockets "
190,"I saw this question Inject into private, package or public field or provide a setter? about how to manually inject into annotated private fields (The way is adding setters or through a constructor) But, the point is how do an application server (like glassfish, axis2, jboss, ...) is able to inject into a final private field (without adding setters or constructors to the user class)? Quoting the cited question: public SomeClass { @Inject private SomeResource resource; } Do they use a customized JVM (not the standard one) that allows to access private fields? Thanks ","It's a simple reflection ""trick"". It relies on the Field.setAccessible() method to force the member to be accessible programmatically: Set the accessible flag for this object to the indicated boolean value. A value of true indicates that the reflected object should suppress Java language access checking when it is used. A value of false indicates that the reflected object should enforce Java language access checks. The Reflection API is used to get a handle on the field, setAccessible() is called, and then it can be set by the injection framework. See an example here. No magic, no custom VM. "

So what i need is the following: The consumer of the attribute should be able to determine if it can be executed.

This is what i have so far but it only implements point 1, 3. [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method, AllowMultiple = false)] public class ExecuteMethodAttribute : Attribute { private Func&lt;object, bool&gt; canExecute; public Func&lt;object, bool&gt; CanExecute { get { return canExecute; } } public ExecuteMethodAttribute() { } public ExecuteMethodAttribute(Func&lt;object, bool&gt; canExecute) { this.canExecute = canExecute; } } ","Attributes are not intended for this type of purpose. You decorate a Type with an attribute, not a specific instance. If you need a way to specify, to a consumer, that a specific method is ready to execute, or cannot execute, I would rethink your design. Instead of using an attribute, perhaps making a custom class would work much more appropriately. Given your design, I would recommend taking a look at the ICommand interface. This basically does exactly what you are trying to do. It encapsulates a delegate into a class, with a ""CanExecute"" method, and an event for notifying ""consumers"" that the execution availability has changed. This would be a more appropriate option. "

211,"I have a combobox where the SelectedValue on the combo is bound to a property on a business object. Everything works fine, but the property that's bound to the SelectedValue on the combo only gets updated when the focus leaves the control. I understand that the property doesn't get updated until the control is validated (loses focus), but I need it to update the datasource as soon as the dropdown is closed.

212,"In other cases it has been suggested that you simply add a SerializationBinder which removes the version from the assembly type. However, when using generic collections of a type found in a signed assembly, that type is strictly versioned based on its assembly. Here is what I've found works. internal class WeaklyNamedAppDomainAssemblyBinder : SerializationBinder { public override Type BindToType(string assemblyName, string typeName) { ResolveEventHandler handler = new ResolveEventHandler(CurrentDomain_AssemblyResolve); AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve += handler; Type returnedType; try { AssemblyName asmName = new AssemblyName(assemblyName); var assembly = Assembly.Load(asmName); returnedType = assembly.GetType(typeName); } catch { returnedType = null; } finally { AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve -= handler; } return returnedType; } Assembly CurrentDomain_AssemblyResolve(object sender, ResolveEventArgs args) { string truncatedAssemblyName = args.Name.Split(',')[0]; Assembly assembly = Assembly.Load(truncatedAssemblyName); return assembly; } } However, causing the binding process to change globally seems rather dangerous to me. Strange things could happen if serialization was happening in multiple threads. Perhaps a better solution is to do some regex manipulation of the typeName? Edit: The string based method does not work. Generics apparently need a full strongly named type. Quite heinous if you ask me. ","The AssemblyResolve event is only fired if regular binding fails. So, anything that can be resolved through normal methods will be. Only deserialization operations are likely to fire the event, and you've got a perfectly valid strategy for trying to resolve those. I'd add the AssemblyResolve event handler when the program starts up and leave it there, rather than adding and removing it. That removes a potential source of multi-threading issues. "

","You need to use the VisualTreeHelper.GetChild and VisualTreeHelper.GetChildrenCount methods to iterate through the view's children until you find the tree that corresponds to your item.

As an example, to hopefully make this clearer consider this code in AlbumListViewController: - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { Album *album = nil; album = [self albumForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath inTableView:tableView]; … if (!album.thumbnail) { [self startThumbnailDownload:album forIndexPath:indexPath inTableView:tableView]; cell.imageView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""Placeholder.png""]; } else { cell.imageView.image = album.thumbnail; } return cell; } This is essentially completely repeated (along with a hell of a lot more repeated code) in ArtistListViewController just so that I can typecast the local variable as an Artist instead of an Album. Is there a way to not explicitly need to set Artist or Album here so that the same code could work for any object that is a child of iPodLibraryGroup? ","Based on a suggestion received on twitter I created a protocol on iPodLibraryGroup as follows: @protocol iPodLibraryGroup &lt;NSObject&gt; @required @property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *name; @property (nonatomic, retain, readonly) NSString *sort_name; … - (void)downloadImageFromURL:(NSURL *)image_url; - (void)cancelImageDownload; - (void)downloadImageCannotStart; @end @interface iPodLibraryGroup : NSObject &lt;iPodLibraryGroup&gt; { … } Then within my view controllers, instead of declaring pointers to declared Artists or Albums I use the syntax: id &lt;iPodLibraryGroup&gt; source; The only issue I encountered was when calling NSObject methods, I would get a compiler warning: This issue is discussed in How to typecast an id to a concrete class dynamically at runtime? and I resolved it by casting my ""source"" reference as an (iPodLibraryGroup *) before calling NSObject methods, for example: [(iPodLibraryGroup *)source addObserver:self forKeyPath:@""pendingResponseForDetailedInfo"" options:0 context:nil]; "
235,"There is a good function that I need, which is implemented in the Java program: ImageJ. I need to understand the algorithm used there. The function has several parameters: link text And before using FFT it converts image to a special one: The Bandpass Filter uses a special algorithm to reduce edge artifacts (before the Fourier transform, the image is extended in size by attaching mirrored copies of image parts outside the original image, thus no jumps occur at the edges) Can you tell me more about this special transform? Actually tiling mirrored image. I am writing on C++ and wish to rewrite that part of the program on C++. EDIT1: I need to understand how it does that tiling mirrored image operation, may be it is special one. Actually at first it converts image to a new sized image, so for my images it will be: convertion from 600X480 to 1024X1024 sized image. How the tiling is used here? EDIT2: Also it is hard to understand this description of tileMirrored function: Puts ImageProcessor (ROI) into a new ImageProcessor of size width x height y at position (x,y). The image is mirrored around its edges to avoid wrap around effects of the FFT. What is meant by ""...of size width x height y at position (x,y). ""? EDIT3: I implemented that bandpass filter, and it gives the same results as the original program. But, the algorithm itself in original program (also in my program) is very slow I want to use that filter not once in my program, but it calculates approximately 0.5 to 2 seconds each call (depending on parameter value). There is used an FHT transform (not FFT), is it more quickly than FFT? I think the filter itself is not optimized, please see filterLargeSmall function implementation: source code ","I don't know exactly how that function works, but here's the basic algorithm for a similar function: Determine the smallest power of two (call it newSize) that is larger than the larger of the two dimensions of the image (call them xSize &amp; ySize). Create a new square image of size newSize by newSize and copy the contents of the image to the center of the new image (ie. the top-left of the image should start at (newSize / 2 - xSize / 2, newSize / 2 - ySize / 2)). Fill in the remaining pixels as follows, for each pixel at (x, y): if x &lt; (newSize / 2 - xSize / 2), copy the pixel at column (newSize / 2 - xSize / 2) + (newSize / 2 - xSize / 2) - x and row y. if y &lt; (newSize / 2 - ySize / 2), copy the pixel at row (newSize / 2 - ySize / 2) + (newSize / 2 - ySize / 2) - y and column x. if both of the above are true, copy the pixel at column (newSize / 2 - xSize / 2) + (newSize / 2 - xSize / 2) - x, row (newSize / 2 - ySize / 2) + (newSize / 2 - ySize / 2) - y. if x &gt; (newSize / 2 + xSize / 2), copy the pixel at column (newSize / 2 + xSize / 2) + (newSize / 2 + xSize / 2) - x and row y. if y &gt; (newSize / 2 + ySize / 2), copy the pixel at row (newSize / 2 + ySize / 2) + (newSize / 2 + ySize / 2) - y and column x. if both of the above are true, copy the pixel at column (newSize / 2 + xSize / 2) + (newSize / 2 + xSize / 2) - x and row (newSize / 2 + ySize / 2) + (newSize / 2 + ySize / 2) - y. There are probably libraries that will make this easier (ie. flipping and copying image data), but I am not familiar with C++, and this should be pretty easy to code yourself as long as performance isn't a huge issue. Be careful of rounding issues for images with odd dimensions: make sure they're consistent. "

240,"When Oracle is estimating the 'Cost' for certain queries, does it actually look at the amount of data (rows) in a table? For example: If I'm doing a full table scan of employees for name='Bob', does it estimate the cost by counting the amount of existing rows, or is it always a set cost? ","In the default configuration, Oracle will check the table statistics (which you can look at by querying the ALL_TABLES view - see the column NUM_ROWS). Normally an Oracle job is run periodically to re-gather these statistics by querying part or all of the table. If the statistics haven't been gathered (yet), the optimizer will (depending on the optimizer_dynamic_sampling parameter) run a quick sample query on the table in order to calculate an estimate for the number of rows in that table. (To be more accurate, the cost of scanning a table is calculated not from the number of rows, but the number of blocks in the table (which you can see in the BLOCKS column in ALL_TABLES). It takes this number and divides it by a factor related to the multi-block read count to calculate the cost of that part of the plan.) "

242,"I'm very new to WCF, so I apologize in advance if I misstate something. This is using .NET 4.0 RC1. Using WCF, I am trying to deserialize a response from the server. The base response has a Stream as its only MessageBodyMember. public abstract class StreamedResponse { [MessageBodyMember] public Stream Stream { get; set; } public StreamedResponse() { this.Stream = Stream.Null; } } The derived versions of this class are actually what's serialized, but they don't have a MessageBodyMember attribute (they have other base types such as int, string, etc listed as MessageHeader values). [MessageContract] public class ChildResponse : StreamedResponse { [DataMember] [MessageHeader] public Guid ID { get; set; } [DataMember] [MessageHeader] public string FileName { get; set; } [DataMember] [MessageHeader] public long FileSize { get; set; } public ChildResponse() : base() { } } The Stream is always a FileStream, in my specific case (but may not always be). At first, WCF said FileStream was not a known type, so I added it to the list of known types and now it serializes. It also appears, at first glance, to deserialize it on the client's side (it's the FileStream type). The problem is that it doesn't seem to be usable. All the CanRead, CanWrite, etc are false, and the Length, Position, etc properties throw exceptions when being used. Same with ReadByte(). What am I missing that would keep me from getting a valid FileStream? ","The short answer is that you can't get a FileStream instance. In WCF, you are working across app-domain boundaries (you don't have to, but it's assumed that you are). Because of this, you can't serialize a FileStream into a value and transport it across the app-domain barrier (the FileStream is app-domain-specific, most notably because it works with unmanaged file handles which don't have meaning outside of the current app-domain). That being said, if you really need information about the stream as well as the contents, then you probably will want to add the information about the stream as message headers and then retrieve those headers, as the Stream instance that you get on the either side will never be the actual stream type that was set on the calling/callee side.

243,"This function of mine keeps on failing an autograder, I am trying to figure out if there is a problem with its logic flow? Any thoughts? Basically, if the row is wrong, ""invalid row"" should be printed, and clearInput(); called, and return false. When y is wrong, ""invalid column"" printed, and clearInput(); called and return false. When both are wrong, only ""invalid row"" is to be printed (and still clearInput and return false. Obviously when row and y are correct, print no error and return true. My function gets through most of the test cases, but fails towards the end, I'm a little lost as to why. bool getCoords(int &amp; x, int &amp; y) { char row; bool noError=true; cin&gt;&gt;row&gt;&gt;y; row=toupper(row); if(row&gt;='A' &amp;&amp; row&lt;='I' &amp;&amp; isalpha(row) &amp;&amp; y&gt;=1 &amp;&amp; y&lt;=9) { x=row-'A'; y=y-1; return true; } else if(!(row&gt;='A' &amp;&amp; row&lt;='I')) { cout&lt;&lt;""Invalid row""&lt;&lt;endl; noError=false; clearInput(); return false; } else { if(noError) { cout&lt;&lt;""Invalid column""&lt;&lt;endl; } clearInput(); return false; } } ","It's hard to know without seeing the input, but here's a couple of possible issues: (1) The way you detect that the column read failed is by examining the value of y - but are you sure that it's set to a value outside the range 1-9 by the calling code? Otherwise even if the read fails you might think it succeeds. You could fix this by adding a y=0; to the beginning of the function. Some more explanation: when you use cin &gt;&gt; y to read an integer into y but there isn't an integer to read (could be because there's a non-digit in the stream, or EOF is reached, or whatever) the value of y won't be touched. So, imagine your input looks like ""CB"". Then after you cin &gt;&gt; row &gt;&gt; y, row contains 'C' and y still contains whatever value it had before the function was called (remember y is a reference to a variable outside this function!) This is the problem: you check to see if the read succeeded by looking at the value of y, but it's quite possible that it is between 1 and 9 even if the read failed (especially if you're calling this function in a loop and reusing the same y). So your code thinks everything went OK, even though it didn't and the stream has now got its failbit set... it's not surprising if everything goes a bit crazy after this point. (2) The way you're reading data using extraction from cin could misbehave if a line is incomplete. That's because the reading of an integer will skip leading whitespace - including newlines. So if the (invalid) input line is just ""B"", for example, you'd read the ""B"" correctly by extracting a char, and then the integer extraction would swallow the newline and fail (assuming the next input line doesn't start with an integer). Then your ignore would completely skip the next line (unless you don't pick up on the failure because of point (1)!). "
244,"What is the best way to implement error handling for a SqlTransaction RollBack that already exists within a catch clause? My code is roughly like this: using (SqlConnection objSqlConn = new SqlConnection(connStr)) { objSqlConn.Open(); using (SqlTransaction objSqlTrans = objSqlConn.BeginTransaction()) { try { // code // more code // and more code } catch (Exception ex) { // What happens if RollBack() has an exception? objSqlTrans.Rollback(); throw ex; } } } I believe that my application had an exception in the try block, which in turn was caught in the catch block and then the RollBack was attempted. However, the error that I'm seeing says something about a SqlTransaction.ZombieCheck(), which is making me wonder if the RollBack() itself threw an exception as well. So, do I need to implement some type of error handling at the RollBack()? How do I do that and manage to hold on to the exception that put the execution into the catch block in the first place?

249,"first, I can't stand Crystal! Okay, that's off my chest... Now, we have an old VB6 app we maintain for a client, which uses the Crystal Automation library to programatically change the record selection formulas in a bunch of Crystal Reports 8.5 reports. There are two reports which are ALMOST identical. I had to change them recently to add another field from another table. When I added the table in to the reports though, while it added it in the visual designer, it did not add it in the FROM clause of the SQL statement. So, I manually edited the SQL statement to add in the additional join. KO, works great. If i run the reports in Crystal preview mode, they work exactly as expected. Now, the users went to test the changes from within the VB app. One of the reports works fine and dandy. The other report however, is failing to set the selection formula as expected. The code sets the selection formulas using the function PESetSelectionFormula. I verified that the string being passed in to the function as the new selection formula is correct via a step-through examination of the variables. The call to PESetSelectionFormula seems to be working okay, and is returning a value of 1, which as near as I can find anywhere indicates success. (The other report, which is working fine from code is also returning 1.) However, the report is failing with an error: Error Code: 534 - Error detected by database DLL. The code, for debugging purposes dumps out the SQL string currently being used by the report. The SQL coming out of the report is: SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ORDER BY ... As you can see, the WHERE clause is blank, which I would imagine is why the database DLL is upchucking on this statement. I don't understand why the automation library is not setting the WHERE clause even though the call to PESetSelectionFormula is being passed a valid string and is returning success. I thought perhaps it was because I had manually edited the SQL in the report to add the table it wasn't adding, but I did the same thing in the other nearly identical report, and that one is working fine. Anyone have any ideas why PESetSelectionFormula might report success but not actually do anything? P.S. I have already tried doing a Database > Verify Database from the menus, and that said the report was all up to date and did not help at all. ","Okay, this is typical of why I just despise Crystal Reports. My boss came back from vacation, and looked at it, ... did nothing, and now it works.

251,"I've been modifying some code to work between Mac OS X and iPhone OS. I came across some code that was using NSURL's URLByAppendingPathComponent: (added in 10.6), which as some may know, isn't available in the iPhone SDK. My solution to make this code work between OS's is to use NSString *urlString = [myURL absoluteString]; urlString = [urlString stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""helloworld""]; myURL = [NSURL urlWithString:urlString]; The problem with this is that NSString's stringByAppendingPathComponent: seems to remove one of the /'s from the http:// part of the URL. Is this intended behaviour or a bug? Edit Ok, So I was a bit too quick in asking the question above. I re-read the documentation and it does say: Note that this method only works with file paths (not, for example, string representations of URLs) However, it doesn't give any pointers in the right direction for what to do if you need to append a path component to a URL on the iPhone... I could always just do it manually, adding a /if necessary and the extra string, but I was looking to keep it as close to the original Mac OS X code as possible... ","I would implement a myURLByAppendingPathComponent: method on NSURL that does the same thing. The reason to give it a different name is so it doesn't override the Apple-provided method when Apple gets around to porting the 10.6 API to the iPhone (so the ""my"" is just an example — the point is that it's unlikely somebody else would write a method with that name). It seems to me you just want to mess with the path rather than the whole URL. Here's an untested example: - (NSURL *)myURLByAppendingPathComponent:(NSString *)component { NSString *newPath = [[self path] stringByAppendingPathComponent:component]; return [[[NSURL alloc] initWithScheme: [self scheme] host: [self host] path: newPath] autorelease]; } It would only work correctly with URLs that have file-like paths, but I'm pretty sure the Apple method works the same way. At any rate, hopefully it helps you in the right direction. "

257,"I am reading the tutorial at http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit-incubator/wiki/LoginSecurityFAQ It states Remember - you must never rely on the sessionID sent to your server in the cookie header ; look only at the sessionID that your GWT app sends explicitly in the payload of messages to your server. Is it use to prevent http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Example_and_characteristics With this mythology, is it sufficient enough to prevent to above attack? ","Yes, it is sufficient to prevent Cross Site Request Forgery. The sessionid in the cookie cannot be trusted. Say a user is logged on to mysite.com and session id is in the cookie. Now the user clicks on a link to evilsite.com. evilsite.com has code like this &lt;img src=""http://mysite.com/transfermoney.jsp?amount=1000.."" /&gt; The browser will make a request to mysite.com, and it will also send along the cookie with the session id. The thing to understand here is that evilsite.com cannot read the cookie, but it can still get its job done. Browser same-origin policy prevents evilsite.com from reading the session identifier whether its in the cookie or embedded in html page. But because browser automatically sends the cookie to your server even if the resource was requested from the html code in another domain, you have XSRF. To prevent this, it is recommended to put the session identifier as a request parameter. If its added as a request parameter, evilsite.com cannot access the identifier, and hence cannot put it in the img src attribute. However, do remember that if your site has XSS vulnerabilities, nothing can prevent you from XSRF. Put it another way, if you have XSS vulnerabilities, an attacker wouldn't even care about doing XSRF. "

260,"If I want to include directories to be searched for header files, which is the preferred way and why? ","From the gcc documentation for -I: Add the directory dir to the head of the list of directories to be searched for header files. This can be used to override a system header file, substituting your own version, since these directories are searched before the system header file directories. However, you should not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied system header files (use -isystem for that). If you use more than one -I option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right order; the standard system directories come after. If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with -isystem, is also specified with -I, the -I option will be ignored. The directory will still be searched but as a system directory at its normal position in the system include chain. This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy system headers and the ordering for the include_next directive are not inadvertently changed. If you really need to change the search order for system directories, use the -nostdinc and/or -isystem options. So -I is probably the preferred option to specify the location of your header files, except for special cases such as vendor-supplied system headers. "

273,"I have been Googling a problem that I have with trying to integrate the web application that I am working on with SharePoint 2010. The web application is a wiki style tool that allows users to log in via forms authentication or WIA against Active Directory and create content for themselves and others. What we would like to do is to allow a user have a page with the content they have created in our web application mixed in with content that they have living on the SharePoint server. For example, they may want to see a list of documents that they have on the SharePoint server mixed in with some of their content. To accomplish this, we would like to take the credentials the user has logged into our web application with (for example MYDOMAIN\jsmith) and be able to query SharePoint for the documents of that same user (MYDOMAIN\jsmith) WITHOUT the user being prompted to re-enter their credentials to access the SharePoint server (we are trying to avoid the double-hop problem) We have come up with some options for how we want to do this, but we are unsure of what the best approach is. For example, we could - Have a global user, shared by all users to get information we need from SharePoint. The downside is that we cannot filter SharePoint content to a particular user - We could store the users credentials when they log in, but that would only work for users authenticating via forms auth and would be a security issue that some users/clients would not like - Writing a SharePoint extension using WCF to allow us to access the information we need, however we'd still have the issue of figuring out how to impersonate the user we want. Neither of these options are ideal and in our investigation we came across the Claims Authentication/STS option which seems like it is trying to solve the problem we are having. So my question is, based on what I have written, is Claims/STS the best approach for us? We have not been able to find much direction on how to use this method to call into SharePoint from a Web Application and pass along the existing credentials. Does anyone have any experience with any of these issues? ","It sounds like you may be overcomplicating the problem. The reason that the user gets asked for credentials twice is that the two parts of the system are on different servers. The easiest solution is probably to implement your custom web app as custom pages/web parts within SharePoint. If that isn't an option, a smaller amount of code on the SharePoint server (maybe a custom web service) should give you a few more options for impersonating a particular user. "

A code snippet: new Ext.Viewport({ layout: ""border"", items: [{ region: ""north"", contentEl: ""title"", height: 50 }, { region: ""center"", id: ""mappanel"", title: ""Map"", xtype: ""gx_mappanel"", map: map, layers: [layer], extent: extent, split: true, tbar: toolbarItems }, { region: ""east"", title: ""Details"", width: 300, split: true, id: ""east-panel"", laout: 'fit' }, { region: ""south"", id: ""south-panel"", height: 200 }, { region: ""west"", id: ""west-panel"", width: 300 }] }); matchedTrailJunctionsPanel = new Ext.Panel({ title: ""Matched Trail Junctions2"", id: ""matched-trail-junctions"", autoScroll:true //layout: 'anchor' }); var southPanel = Ext.getCmp('south-panel'); southPanel.add(matchedTrailJunctionsPanel); southPanel.doLayout(); createTrailJunctionPanel = function(trailJunction) { var trailJunctionPanel = new Ext.form.FormPanel({ labelWidth: 75, width: 350, defaultType: 'textfield', items: [{ fieldLabel: 'Junction Name', name: 'junction-name' }], autoScroll:true, //anchor: '100% 100%', height: 100 }); matchedTrailJunctionsPanel.add(trailJunctionPanel); if(trailJunction.publicTrailSegments.length == 0) { matchedTrailJunctionsPanel.add(new Ext.form.Label({text: 'No public trails matched'})); } else { var grid = new Ext.grid.GridPanel({ store: mapMatchObjectStore, columns: [ {id:'publicTrailSegment',header: 'Trail', width: 160, sortable: true, dataIndex: 'publicTrailSegment'} ], stripeRows: true, autoExpandColumn: 'publicTrailSegment', height: 350, width: 600, title: 'Matched Trail Junctions' }); matchedTrailJunctionsPanel.add(grid); } matchedTrailJunctionsPanel.doLayout(); } ","Your south panel is the main container for your components, so it should be autoScroll:true and you should be adding both your form and grid into it. You can't really add a grid into a FormPanel directly as it's not a form field (you'd have to wrap it as a Field or implement some of Field's interface). It may work with south having no layout (the browser should just stick the grid directly after the form) but generally it's better to specify an appropriate layout (vbox would be a good one in this case).

278,"Is there any way to get the collection of all textNode objects within a document? getElementsByTagName() works great for Elements, but textNodes are not Elements. Update: I realize this can be accomplished by walking the DOM - as many below suggest. I know how to write a DOM-walker function that looks at every node in the document. I was hoping there was some browser-native way to do it. After all it's a little strange that I can get all the &lt;input&gt;s with a single built-in call, but not all textNodes. ","Update: I have outlined some basic performance tests for each of these 6 methods over 1000 runs. getElementsByTagName is the fastest but it does a half-assed job, as it does not select all elements, but only one particular type of tag ( i think p) and blindly assumes that its firstChild is a text element. It might be little flawed but its there for demonstration purpose and comparing its performance to TreeWalker. Run the tests yourselves on jsfiddle to see the results. Using a TreeWalker Custom Iterative Traversal Custom Recursive Traversal Xpath query querySelectorAll getElementsByTagName Let's assume for a moment that there is a method that allows you to get all Text nodes natively. You would still have to traverse each resulting text node and call node.nodeValue to get the actual text as you would do with any DOM Node. So the issue of performance is not with iterating through text nodes, but iterating through all nodes that are not text and checking their type. I would argue (based on the results) that TreeWalker performs just as fast as getElementsByTagName, if not faster (even with getElementsByTagName playing handicapped). Ran each test 1000 times.

279,"I've got a object that defines a 'natural sort order' using Comparable&lt;>. These are being stored in TreeSets. Other than removing and re-adding the object, is there another way to update the sort when the members that are used to define the sort order are updated?

282,"My SSRS report fetches data from my DATAWAREHOUSE. The ASP.NET application I have is connected to an OLTP database. I invoke the SSRS Report from my ASP.NET application and provide a parameter as CustomerID(this is an application key in datawarehouse) to my report. Since my report is connected to my datawarehouse, I do not query my report databased on the OLTP's CustomerID. Instead I use my datawarehouse's surrogate key (CustomerDimKey). Now, in my report, I need to find the correct surrogate key for the CustomerID parameter, which I passed from my ASP.NET application! My report already has a parameter as @CustomerDimKey(this is used across all the report sprocs). We used it for testing, but now we'll hide this as we have integrated it with the ASP.NET application. I have already added a new parameter to the report as @CustomerID(this will have the OLTP's CustomerID), which will now get a value from ASP.NET. I need to know a way to re-use the @CustomerDimKey report parameter, which should now get value from a sql statement or a sproc once the report is requested. Based on the value contained by the @CustomerID parameter. ","Sounds pretty simple. Assuming you have SQL or a stored proc that can look up the CustomerDimKey, just add a dataset that does so using @CustomerID parameter then selects that CustomerDimKey. Let's assume it's a stored proc called LookUpCustomerDimKey that takes the @CustomerID and an output parameter @CustomerDimKey. I'd create a report dataset like so: declare @CustomerDimKey bigint exec LookUpCustomerDimKey @CustomerID, @CustomerDimKey out select @CustomerDimKey CustomerDimKey Then set the CustomerDimKey report parameter to be internal and get its default value from the query I just created. Now the report will wait for CustomerID to be provided then calculate the CustomerDimKey before using it in your other report datasets. It doesn't have to be a stored proc, of course. You just have to make sure the body of the dataset produces a single row result set containing the key. It can be a simple SQL select or a series of TSQL statements or stored proc calls. Pretty much anything that you could put into a stored proc can go into the dataset body. It just needs to ultimately produce a row. "

What you are asking for is a C# specific syntax. As far as .NET is concerned, this is proper: System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.String] So to get what you want, you'd have to write a function to build it the way you want it. Perhaps like so: static string GetCSharpRepresentation( Type t, bool trimArgCount ) { if( t.IsGenericType ) { var genericArgs = t.GetGenericArguments().ToList(); return GetCSharpRepresentation( t, trimArgCount, genericArgs ); } return t.Name; } static string GetCSharpRepresentation( Type t, bool trimArgCount, List&lt;Type&gt; availableArguments ) { if( t.IsGenericType ) { string value = t.Name; if( trimArgCount &amp;&amp; value.IndexOf(""`"") &gt; -1 ) { value = value.Substring( 0, value.IndexOf( ""`"" ) ); } if( t.DeclaringType != null ) { // This is a nested type, build the nesting type first value = GetCSharpRepresentation( t.DeclaringType, trimArgCount, availableArguments ) + ""+"" + value; } // Build the type arguments (if any) string argString = """"; var thisTypeArgs = t.GetGenericArguments(); for( int i = 0; i &lt; thisTypeArgs.Length &amp;&amp; availableArguments.Count &gt; 0; i++ ) { if( i != 0 ) argString += "", ""; argString += GetCSharpRepresentation( availableArguments[0], trimArgCount ); availableArguments.RemoveAt( 0 ); } // If there are type arguments, add them with &lt; &gt; if( argString.Length &gt; 0 ) { value += ""&lt;"" + argString + ""&gt;""; } return value; } return t.Name; } For these types (with true as 2nd param): typeof( List&lt;string&gt; ) ) typeof( List&lt;Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;&gt; ) It returns: List&lt;String&gt; List&lt;Dictionary&lt;Int32, String&gt;&gt; In general though, I'd bet you probably don't need to have the C# representation of your code and perhaps if you do, some format better than the C# syntax would be more appropriate.

For example, say query one returns data types in the following order: Integer String Any subsequent query that is union'd to the first has to return the same data types in the same position. Pay special attention to the fact of data types - it doesn't guarantee the data within the column. The second issue to UNIONs is knowing the difference between UNION and UNION ALL. UNION will remove duplicates if they exist (equivalent to using DISTINCT), which is not desired in the given scenario. UNION ALL will not remove duplicates, and is faster because of this. "

I hope it helps :-) Here's the plugin code: function InfoBox(opt_opts) { opt_opts = opt_opts || {}; this.imgPath='img/infoBox/'; google.maps.OverlayView.apply(this, arguments); // Standard options (in common with google.maps.InfoWindow): this.content_ = opt_opts.content || """"; this.maxWidth_ = opt_opts.maxWidth || 0; this.pixelOffset_ = opt_opts.pixelOffset || new google.maps.Size(0, 0); this.position_ = opt_opts.position || new google.maps.LatLng(0, 0); this.zIndex_ = opt_opts.zIndex || null; // Additional options (unique to InfoBox): this.boxStyle_ = opt_opts || {}; this.infoBoxClearance_ = new google.maps.Size(1, 1); this.isHidden_ = opt_opts.isHidden || false; this.pane_ = ""overlayMouseTarget""; this.enableEventPropagation_ = opt_opts.enableEventPropagation || false; this.div_ = null; this.closeListener_ = null; this.eventListener1_ = null; this.eventListener2_ = null; this.eventListener3_ = null; this.contextListener_ = null; this.fixedWidthSet_ = null; } /* InfoBox extends OverlayView in the Google Maps API v3. */ InfoBox.prototype = new google.maps.OverlayView(); // Creates the DIV representing the InfoBox. @private InfoBox.prototype.createInfoBoxDiv_ = function(){ var bw, me = this; // This handler prevents an event in the InfoBox from being passed on to the map. var cancelHandler = function (e){ e.cancelBubble = true; if (e.stopPropagation) e.stopPropagation(); }; // This handler ignores the current event in the InfoBox and conditionally prevents the event from being passed on to the map.

297,"I'm using a 500.html template for my app, which is an identical copy of the 404.html with some minor text changes. Interestingly the {{ media_url }} context variable will not be resolved by the server if the 500.html is presented (e.g. when I force an internal server error), resulting in a page without any css loaded. An easy way to circumvent this would be to hardcode the links to the css, but I m just curious why the media_url is not resolved. Probably it is because the server encounters a internal server error and that leads to context variables not any more available!? ","The 500 error handler doesn't pass a RequestContext to the template, it just uses a Context. As you may know, MEDIA_URL is added in a context processor, which are only included when you use a RequestContext. You can set your own 500 handler and pass a RequestContext if you want.

302,"I'm currently working on a website in PHP, and I'm wondering what the best practices/methods are to reduce the time requests take. I've build the site in a modular way, so a page would consist of a number of modules, and each of these would need to request information. For example, I have a cart module, that (if a cart is set) will fetch the cart with the id (stored in a session variable) from the database and return its contents. I have another module that lists categories and this needs to fetch the categories from the database. My system is built with models, and each model might also make a request, for example a category model will make a request to get products in that category. For those interested, im running the application on Windows Server 2003 with IIS at the moment, but i am hoping to change to linux in the near future. I know this is a broad subject, im just curious about what to look out for and tool to use to help with the load., the answers so far have been very helpful. ","Your high-level approach sounds reasonable, although it would be helpful to weigh such an approach against your actual code, data, and environment. That said: A quick and easy way to make your code run even faster is to use a tool such as eAccelerator which will cache compiled PHP scripts. That way when a second request comes in the script does not have to be compiled a second time, which improves performance. If you are developing a site with a large amount of users, you might consider caching data from the database, using a tool such as memcached. "
303,"Dear members of the Stackoverflow community, We are developing a web application using the Zend Framework, and we are facing some encoding issues that we hope you might help us solve. The situation goes something like this: There are certain tables on a MySQL database that need to be displayed as html. Because the site is designed using the Spanish language, the database contains some characters like ""á"" or ""ñ"". Our internal policy is to set all the encodings as UTF-8, including all the databases and the tables. The problem is, that when we retrieve the content from the DB, some characters are displayed as question marks. We are out of ideas. These are all the things that we have already tried and double-checked: 1. The SQL file from which we load all the data is properly UTF-8 encoded. 2. The SQL is loaded through phpmyadmin (which is configured as UTF-8), and the resulting tables are displayed properly. 3. The netbeans environment used for coding is also set as UTF-8. The weird thing is that all the content that is hard-coded either as php or html is displayed properly. Only the values that are extracted from the database have issues. Any ideas? Thank you very much. ","do you use resources.db.params.charset = ""utf8"" in your config file like (application.ini)? "
304,"I have a DataGridView that's bound to a DataSet. It has columns DateCreated, Weight, DateUsed. Those three columns do not take up much horizontal space on DataGridView that is nearly full screen. Is it possible to have those columns wrap back to the top if the view is wide enough to support a second group of those colums.

You would need to decouple the actual data from the presentation of the data. Instead of a single DataRow per grid row, you'll need to merge them together to show multiple rows on a single row. So your helper method might do the following: Compare the width of the DataGridView to the number of rows Determine how many DataRows columns would be visible Build a new DataTable with extra column sets to represent each column Example: DateCreated1, Weight1, DateUsed1, DateCreated2, Weight2, DateUsed2, etc. Populate the DataTable with the original DataSet Bind the DataGridView to the new table Some considerations: can users sort the data?

305,"I have my application designed with Repository pattern implemented and my code prepared for optional dependency injection in future, if we need to support another datastore. I want to create a custom validation attribute for my content objects. This attribute should perform some kind of datastore lookup. For instance, I need my content to have unique slugs. To check if a Slug already exist, I want to use custom DataAnnotation attribute in my Base content object (instead of manually checking if a slug exists each time in my controller's Insert actions). Attribute logic would do the validation. So far I have come up with this: public class UniqueSlugAttribute : ValidationAttribute { private readonly IContentRepository _repository; public UniqueSlugAttribute(ContentType contentType) { _repository = new XmlContentRepository(contentType); } public override bool IsValid(object value) { if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(value.ToString())) { return false; } string slug = value.ToString(); if(_repository.IsUniqueSlug(slug)) return true; return false; } } part of my Base content class: ... [DataMember] public ContentType ContentType1 { get; set; } [DataMember] [Required(ErrorMessageResourceType = typeof (Localize), ErrorMessageResourceName = ""Validation_SlugIsBlank"")] [UniqueSlug(ContentType1)] public string Slug { get { return _slug; } set { if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(value)) _slug = Utility.RemoveIllegalCharacters(value); } } ... There's an error in line [UniqueSlug(ContentType1)] saying: ""An attribute argument must be a constant expression, typeof expression or array creation expression of an attribute parameter type."" Let me explain that I need to provide the ContentType1 parameter to the Constructor of UniqueSlug class because I use it in my data provider. It is actually the same error that appears if you try do to this on the built-in Required attribute: [Required(ErrorMessageResourceType = typeof (Localize), ErrorMessageResourceName = Resources.Localize.SlugRequired] It does not allow us to set it to dynamic content. In the first case ContentType1 gets known at runtime, in the second case the Resources.Localize.SlugRequired also gets known at runtime (because the Culture settings are assigned at runtime). This is really annoying and makes so many things and implementation scenarios impossible. So, my first question is, how to get rid of this error? The second question I have, is whether you think that I should redesign my validation code in any way? ","The only way to get rid of the error is to do what it says, and put static content in your attributes. Remember that the purpose of attributes is for metadata on your code that is specifically for the purposes of looking up information about your code at runtime. Making this dynamic would defeat this purpose. It seems to me that if your slug is dynamic based on the content type, then the Slug property should be an object that is initialized with the content type. From the attribute code posted, there's no need to initialize your repository in the constructor anyway - so move it to the IsValid() method and do everything in there, and just do a bit of checking to make sure the the value casts to a Slug and that the ContentType property is set. If you need to be doing a ton of dynamic implementation scenarios around attributes, this could be indicative of a design problem. "

So in Java, you might as well get the chore out of the way up front. In Python, this is silly, because you can start with a normal attribute and change your mind at any time, without affecting any clients of the class. So, don't write getters and setters. "

Informix has a DATE constructor function MDY() which takes three integer arguments: the month, day and year (the name is mnemonic). It also has three analysis functions: DAY(), MONTH() and YEAR() which return the day, month and year of the date argument. The inner query with the FULL JOIN gives you the results with nulls on both left and right sides. The 5-part criterion in the ON clause seems to be necessary; otherwise, the criteria in the outer query has to be more complex and confusing - if it can be made to work at all. Then the criteria in the outer selection ensure that the right data is chosen. One advantage of the NVL() expressions in the inner query is that the store ID columns are both the same and not null and neither date column is null, so the order by clause can be simpler - on store ID and either date column. In Informix, it would also be possible to to rework the date expressions as: NVL(s1.date, s2.date + 1 UNITS YEAR) NVL(s2.date, s1.date - 1 UNITS YEAR) There are actually multiple type conversions going on behind the scenes with that notation, but it gives you the same result and the extra calculation is probably not all that significant. There is also a glitch in waiting in Informix; you cannot add or subtract 1 year to or from any February 29th - because there is no 29th February in the following or previous year. You would need to be careful with your data; if you're not, you could end up comparing the data for 2008-02-29 with 2009-02-28 (as well as comparing the data for 2008-02-28 with 2009-02-28). There is a process called 'double entry bookkeeping', but this isn't what is meant by it, and your computations could be confused if '2008-02-29 plus 1 year' is 2009-02-28. Informix generates an error; that isn't very much more helpful. You might code a stored procedure, probably, to return NULL for 2008-02-29 plus 1 year since there isn't any date to compare its sales with. You should be able to adapt the date arithmetic to MySQL fairly easily; the rest of the code does not need to to change. "

309,"In my application I have several activities, the main screen has 4 buttons that each start a different activity. So one of them is a search activity, once it searches it shows you a result activity. This result activity can be reached from other activities, so in general something like this: Main activity -&gt; Search activity -&gt; Result activity Main acitivty -&gt; someother activity -&gt; Result activity Now, if I have reached this result activity and press back once or twice, and after that press the Home key it will show the Home screen. But if I want to get back to my application by holding the Home button and clicking on my app it will always go back to the Result activity, no matter which activity was the last one I was using. And if I press again back it will take me back to the Home screen. If I try it again it will take me again to the Result activity. The only way to avoid this is to start the application by clicking on the app's icon. And this takes me to the last activity I was using and it remembers the state so if I press back again it doesn't take me to the Home screen, instead to the activity before it. To illustrate this: Main activity -&gt; Search activity -&gt; result activity --back--&gt; Search activity --Home Button--&gt; Home Screen --Hold Home and select the app --&gt; Result activity --back--&gt; Home Screen --Click application icon--&gt; Search activity --back--&gt; Main activity Another thing that happens is that if I press the Home button while on the Result activity, and start the app by clicking the icon, it will take me to the activity prior the the Result one.

There isn't really a nicer way. Edit: Here's a recursive deep_dup method that works with arbitrarily nested arrays: class Array def deep_dup map {|x| x.deep_dup} end end class Object def deep_dup dup end end class Numeric # We need this because number.dup throws an exception # We also need the same definition for Symbol, TrueClass and FalseClass def deep_dup self end end You might also want to define deep_dup for other containers (like Hash), otherwise you'll still get a shallow copy for those.

314,"I am going trough the OWASP Top 10 list of 2007 and 2010. I stumbled upon Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) this is often called session riding as you let the user usee his session to fulfill your wishes. Now a solution to this is adding a token to every url and this token is checked for every link. For example to vote on product x the url would be: 'http://mysite.com?token=HVBKJNKL' This looks like a solid solution to because a hacker can not guess the token. But I was thinking of the following scenario(I do not know if it is possible): You create a website with an hidden iFrame or div. After that you can load my website in it either using just the normal iFrame or ajax. When you have my website loaded hidden inside your website, and the user has a stored session, the following can be done. You can retrieve the token from the URLS, and still do all the actions needed. Is it possible to do something like this. Or is it not possible to do this cross domain.

319,"Wikipedia says: Selection algorithms: Finding the min, max, both the min and max, median, or even the k-th largest element can be done in linear time using heaps. All it says is that it can be done, and not how. Can you give me some start on how this can be done using heaps? ","You would use a min-max-median heap to find the min, max and median in constant time (and take linear time to build the heap). You can use order-statistics trees to find the kth smallest/largest value. Both of these data structures are described in this paper on min-max heaps [PDF]. Min-max heaps are binary heaps that alternate between min-heaps and max-heaps. From the paper: A min-max-median heap is a binary tree with the following properties: The median of all elements is located at the root The left subtree of the root is a min-max heap Hl of size ceiling[((n-1)/2)] containing elements less than or equal to the median. The right subtree is a max-min heap Hr of size floor[((n-1)/2)] containing only elements greater than or equal to the median. The paper goes on to explain how to build such a heap. Upon reading the paper more thoroughly it appears as though building the min-max-median heaps requires that you first find the median (FTA: &quot;Find the median of all n elements using any one of the known linear-time algorithms&quot;). That said, once you have built the heap you can maintain the median simply by maintaining the balance between the min-max heap on the left and the max-min heap on the right. DeleteMedian replaces the root with either the min of the max-min heap or the max of the min-max heap (whichever maintains the balance). So if you plan on using a min-max-median heap to find the median of a fixed data set you're SOL but if you are using it on a changing data set it is possible. "

So user extending main only makes the methods of main available to it. If other classes extend main it doesn't allow all of them to call each others methods. You could have user extend mysql and mysql's methods would then be available to user though I don't believe that fundamentally this is what you're looking for. I think you're looking for something along the lines of dependency injection and not class inheritance. For example if you wanted your user class to have access to your mysql class you pass it an instance of it in it's constructor. class user { protected $_mysql; public function __construct(mysql $mysql) { $this-&gt;_mysql = $mysql; } public function myMethod() { $this-&gt;_mysql-&gt;myMysqlMethod(); } } $mysql = new mysql(); $user = new user($mysql); $user-&gt;myMethod(); Here's some good reading on dependency injection. PHP Dependency Injection Symphony Dependency Injection The Symphony link in particular is a pretty nice read on the overview of dependency injection and how to setup a dependency container. 
322,Given a method.. public ActionResult Method() { // program logic if(condition) { // external library // external library returns an ActionResult } return View(viewname); } I cannot control the return type or method of the external library. I want to catch its results and handle that in a dialog on the page - but I cannot figure out how to get back to the page to execute the jQuery that would be responsible for it. Any ideas? ,"You can call Method() by just routing your jQuery .ajax() request to it. Since it's just returning straight up html, make sure you set your response type to expect that, and then your jQuery callback handler will have to deal with the resulting html. For example, $(""#myButton"").click({ $.ajax({ // Basic ajax request properties url: /* route to call Method() */, data: {} dataType: ""html"", type: ""GET"", success: function(objResponse){ alert(objResponse); // alerts the html of the result /* Deal with response here, put the html in a dialog */ } }) }); "
323,"In AS3, if I have a class such: public class dude { //default value for a dude protected var _strength:Number = 1; public function dude( ):void { super( ); //todo... calculate abilities of a dude based on his strength. } } and a subclass public class superDude extends dude { public function superDude( ):void { _strength = 100; super( ); trace( ""strength of superDude: "" + _strength ); } } This will trace strength of superDude is 1. I expected the variable I set in the subclass (prior to calling the superclass constructor) to remain. Is there a way to assign class variables in subclass constructors which are not over-written by the superclass construtor? Or should I pass them up as constructor variables? ",You are calling super() after setting _strength to 100; this instruction is going to call the constructor from the super class which is going to change back _strength to 1 (the variable initialization happens in constructor). There is no way to prevent that and I think you should call super() before initializing the variables.

326,"This question is similar to a couple others I have found on StackOverflow, but the differences are signficant enough to me to warrant a new question, so here it is: I want to obtain a result set from dynamic SQL in Oracle and then display it as a result set in a SqlDeveloper-like tool, just as if I had executed the dynamic SQL statement directly. This is straightforward in SQL Server, so to be concrete, here is an example from SQL Server that returns a result set in SQL Server Management Studio or Query Explorer: EXEC sp_executesql N'select * from countries' Or more properly: DECLARE @stmt nvarchar(100) SET @stmt = N'select * from countries' EXEC sp_executesql @stmt The question ""How to return a resultset / cursor from a Oracle PL/SQL anonymous block that executes Dynamic SQL?"" addresses the first half of the problem--executing dynamic SQL into a cursor. The question ""How to make Oracle procedure return result sets"" provides a similar answer. Web search has revealed many variations of the same theme, all addressing just the first half of my question. I found this post explaining how to do it in SqlDeveloper, but that uses a bit of functionality of SqlDeveloper. I am actually using a custom query tool so I need the solution to be self-contained in the SQL code. This custom query tool similarly does not have the capability to show output of print (dbms_output.put_line) statements; it only displays result sets. Here is yet one more possible avenue using 'execute immediate...bulk collect', but this example again renders the results with a loop of dbms_output.put_line statements. This link attempts to address the topic but the question never quite got answered there either. Assuming this is possible, I will add one more condition: I would like to do this without having to define a function or procedure (due to limited DB permissions). That is, I would like to execute a self-contained PL/SQL block containing dynamic SQL and return a result set in SqlDeveloper or a similar tool. So to summarize: I want to execute an arbitrary SQL statement (hence dynamic SQL). The platform is Oracle. The solution must be a PL/SQL block with no procedures or functions. The output must be generated as a canonical result set; no print statements. The output must render as a result set in SqlDeveloper without using any SqlDeveloper special functionality. Any suggestions? ","You seem to be asking for a chunk of PL/SQL code that will take an arbitrary query returning result set of undetermined structure and 'forward/restructure' that result set in some way such that is can easily be rendered by some ""custom GUI tool"". If so, look into the DBMS_SQL for dynamic SQL. It has a DESCRIBE_COLUMNS procedure which returns the columns from a dynamic SELECT statement. The steps you would need are, Parse the statement Describe the result set (column names and data types) Fetch each row, and for each column, call the datatype dependent function to return that value into a local variable Place those local variables into a defined structure to return to the calling environment (eg consistent column names [such as col_1, col_2] probably all of VARCHAR2) As an alternative, you could try building the query into an XMLFOREST statement, and parse the results out of the XML. Added : Unlike SQL Server, an Oracle PL/SQL call will not 'naturally' return a single result set. It can open up one or more ref cursors and pass them back to the client. It then becomes the client's responsibility to fetch records and columns from those ref cursors. If your client doesn't/can't deal with that, then you cannot use a PL/SQL call. A stored function can return a pre-defined collection type, which can allow you to do something like ""select * from table(func_name('select * from countries'))"". However the function cannot do DML (update/delete/insert/merge) because it blows away any concept of consistency for that query. Plus the structure being returned is fixed so that select * from table(func_name('select * from countries')) must return the same set of columns (column names and data types) as select * from table(func_name('select * from persons')) It is possible, using DBMS_SQL or XMLFOREST, for such a function to take a dynamic query and restructure it into a pre-defined set of columns (col_1, col_2, etc) so that it can be returned in a consistent manner. But I can't see what the point of it would be. "
327,"I'm trying to check if a folder has any subfolders without iterating through its children, in Linux. The closest I've found so far is using ftw and stopping at the first subfolder - or using scandir and filtering through the results. Both, are, however, an overkill for my purposes, I simply want a yes/no. On Windows, this is done by calling SHGetFileInfo and then testing dwAttributes &amp; SFGAO_HASSUBFOLDER on the returned structure. Is there such an option on Linux? ","The standard answer is to call stat on the directory, then check the st_nlink field (""number of hard links""). On a standard filesystem, each directory is guaranteed to have 2 hard links (. and the link from the parent directory to the current directory), so each hard link beyond 2 indicates a subdirectory (specifically, the subdirectory's .. link to the current directory). However, it's my understanding that filesystems aren't required to implement this (see, e.g., this mailing list posting), so it's not guaranteed to work. Otherwise, you have to do as you're doing: Iterate over the directory's contents using glob with the GNU-specific GLOB_ONLYDIR flag, or scandir, or readdir. Call stat on each result and check S_ISDIR(s.st_mode) to verify that files found are directories. Or, nonportably, check struct dirent.d_type: if it's DT_DIR then it's a file, and if it's DT_UNKNOWN, you'll have to stat it after all. "

If the responding page is not open, nothing should happen. ","If it are two independent pages, your best bet is to use either HTTP push (read on about ""Comet"") or Ajax poll. I only question why you were explicitly asking for linking two pages (and not three or more), so those pages must be somehow related to each other. If the second page is actually opened by for example Javascript window.open(), then you can make use of the window instance to access the second page and the window.opener property to access the parent page from the second page. JSP as being a view technology can't do much for you here since it is just there to generate and send all the necessary HTML/CSS/JS, if not with help of taglibs and/or EL to access the ""backend"" Java code.

349,"I'm really looking for something very similar to the way SO is setup where a few different kinds of things can be voted on (questions AND answers). What kind of DB schema, generally, could I use to support voting on many different kinds of objects? Would I have a single Vote table that would have references to other objects in the database? Or do I have to have or should have a separate vote table for each of the objects I would like to vote on. ","Kyle, it's a bit hard to understand what exactly you need...but here's my 2 cents: I assume you want for each vote to store when it was voted, by whom (maybe IP address or user name), I would go for a single Voting table solution. I also assume that when you query an entity from the DB (question, answer, etc.), you also want to join this table, and it's not likely to have a query solely on the voting table. in this case, you can use 2 columns on the voting table - one for the type of object that was voted, and one to hold the id of that object. that way you can join the voting table to any other query by specifying the type of the object. I think managing all your votes in a single table will make your domain simpler then spreading it and creating a voting table for each entity. in this single voting table solution you only need to maintain the list of types of entities (probably using a small dictionary table). there is also a consideration of performance. if you expect millions of votes, that single table will grow much more quickly than a set of separate tables. it might be a consideration against it. also take care to not make it a bottleneck if there are many concurrent read/writes to it.

352,"I need to show a list of movies ordered by the date they were registered in the system and the amount of comments users have made about them. E.g: Title | Register Date | # of comments Gladiator | 02-01-2010 | 30 Matrix | 01-02-2010 | 20 It is a web application that follows MVC. So, I have the object ""Movie"", there is a MovieManager interface that is used for retrieving/persisting data to the database and a servlet RecentlyAddedMovies.java that forwards to a .jsp to render the list. I will explain my problem by showing an example of how I am doing another similar task: Showing top ranked movies. Regarding the MovieManager: /** * Returns a collection of the x best-ranked movies * @param x the amount of movies to return * @return A collection of movies * @throws SQLException */ public Collection&lt;Movie&gt; getTopX(int x) throws SQLException; The servlet: public class Top5 extends HttpServlet{ @Override protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException { MovieManager movManager = JDBCMovieManager.getInstance(); try { req.setAttribute(""movies"", movManager.getTopX(5)); } catch (SQLException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } req.getRequestDispatcher(""listMovies.jsp"").forward(req, resp); } } And the listMovies.jsp has is some place something like: &lt;c:forEach var=""movie"" items=""${movies}""&gt; ... &lt;c:out value=""${movie.title}""/&gt; ... &lt;/c:forEach&gt; The difference between the top5 problem and the problem I am trying to solve is that with the top5 thing all the data I needed to show in the view where part of the ""Movie"" object, so the MovieManager simply returned a Collection of Movies. Now, the MovieManager must retrieve an ordered list of (Movie, # of comments). The Movie object has a collection of Comment associated but of course, it lacks an instance variable with the length of that collection. The following things came into my mind: a) Create a MovieView object or something like that, that is only used by the ""View"" and ""Controller"" layer of the MVC which is not part of the ""Model"" in the sense that is used only for easy retrieval and display of information. This MovieView object will have a title, registerDate and # of Comments so the thing would look something like this: /** * Returns a collection of the x most recently added movies * @param x the amount of movies to return * @return A collection of movies * @throws SQLException */ public Collection&lt;Movie2&gt; getXRecentlyAddedMovies(int x) throws SQLException; The .jsp: &lt;c:forEach var=""movie2"" items=""${movies2}""&gt; ... &lt;c:out value=""${movie2.title}""/&gt; &lt;c:out value=""${movie2.registerDate}""/&gt; &lt;c:out value=""${movie2.noOfComments}""/&gt; ... &lt;/c:forEach&gt; b) Add to the Collection the movie has, empty Comments (there is no actual need to retrieve all the comment data from the database) so that the comment's collection.size() will show the number of comments that movie has. (This sounds horrible to me) c) Add to the ""Movie"" object an instance field noOfComments with the setter and getter that will help with this type of cases even if, looking only from the object point of view, it is a redundant field since it already has a Collection that is "".size()""able . d) Make the MovieManager retrieve some structure like a Map or a Collection of a two component array or something like that that will contain both a Movie object and the associated number of comments and with JSLT iterate over it and show it accordingly. ","First: You should use List, not Collection, because the iteration order of Collection is not guaranteed. Second: I prefer something like Option D, but instead of a two-element array, I'd suggest some sort of a genericized Pair class. "

I want a constant array of [array address, array size] which is generated at compile time. I am using Green Hills ccarm 4.24, on Windows XP, C language NOT C++. ","C's const qualifier has little to do with what the compiler considers a constant expression, in this case. In an initializer, ie const struct attributes attrs[] = { { expr1, expr2 }, ... } expr1 and expr2 must have very specific forms to be acceptable to the compiler. The upshot of these restrictions is that the expressions can be evaluated without fetching from program variables, since these aren't in existence at compilation. You're attempting to use data1_size and data2_size, which are not compile time constants by these rules. By the way, the declarations const unsigned char data1[] = { ... }; and extern const unsigned char *data1; are not compatible and will lead to a bug in your code. The latter should be extern const unsigned char data1[]; "
354,"I'm trying to solve a problem that anonymous functions make much, much easier, and was wondering if this was possible in c++.

In C# I would do p => p*5. I know this is easy with C++0x, but I can't use that. I feel that I should be able to do it with either boost::lambda, or a compination of boost::bind and boost::function with placeholders, but I can't seem to get it to work. This may not be possible and thats also fine, but please answer if its not possible. Thanks. EDIT: Ok, it seems the simple case of an int works fine, what about a more complicated structure? So, lets try struct NumHolder { int x; } template&lt;typename T&gt; T DoSomething(T one, function&lt;T(NumHolder)&gt; dosomething) { NumHolder temp; temp = 5 return one + dosomething(temp); } void GetMyVal(...) { DoSomething&lt;int&gt;(1, /*anonymous func here*/) } Here my C# expression would be along the lines of p => p.temp * 5. Is this possible to do in C++ with boost? EDIT 2: OK, now I'm just curious :D How would I call a function within the lambda expression? So, if we have int ChangeVal(int mult) { return mult*5; } struct NumHolder { int x; } template&lt;typename T&gt; T DoSomething(T one, function&lt;T(NumHolder)&gt; dosomething) { NumHolder temp; temp = 5 return one + dosomething(temp); } void GetMyVal(...) { DoSomething&lt;int&gt;(1, /*anonymous func here*/) } In C# I could call p => ChangeVal(p). What would the syntax be for this with the C++ lambda expressions? ","As Anders notes in his answer, boost::lambda can be useful, but the code can become hard to read in some cases. It thus depends on what you want to do in your anonymous function. For simple case like the p =&gt; p * 5 you mention in your question, it seems to me that using Lambda or Bind would be reasonable, though: DoSomething(1, _1 * 5); Edit: Your second example hits one area where the syntax gets quickly verbose: Member (data or function) access. Because the ""dot"" operator can't be overloaded in C++, you have to use a bind expression to get the ""x"" from the argument: DoSomething(1, bind(&amp;NumHolder::x, _1) * 5); or, with Boost.Lambda, use the overloaded ->* operator: DoSomething(1, &amp;_1-&gt;* &amp;NumHolder::x * 5); Edit 2: OK, one last time :) In your last question, you write that in C#, you'd write p =&gt; ChangeVal(p), but the code above shows a ChangeVal taking an int, not a NumHolder, so it's not clear what you mean. Assuming that ChangeVal takes an int and that you want the anonymous function to do the equivalent of ChangeVal(the_arg.x), you'd write this with Boost.Lambda: DoSomething(1, bind(&amp;ChangeVal, &amp;_1-&gt;*&amp;NumHolder::x)); or this with Boost.Bind (works with Lambda too): DoSomething(1, bind(&amp;ChangeVal, bind(&amp;NumHolder::x, _1)); "

361,"I have a C++ program that uses a std::list containing instances of a class. If I call e.g. myList.push_back(MyClass(variable)); it goes through the process of creating a temporary variable, and then immediately copies it to the vector, and afterwards deletes the temporary variable. This is not nearly as efficient as I want, and sucks when you need a deep copy. I would love to have the constructor of my class new something and not have to implement a copy constructor just to allocate my memory for the second time and waste runtime. I'd also rather not have to immediately find the class instance from the vector/list and then manually allocate the memory (or do something horrible like allocate the memory in the copy constructor itself). Is there any way around this (I'm not using Visual Studio BTW)? ","C++0x move constructors are a partial workaround: instead of the copy constructor being invoked, the move constructor would be. The move constructor is like the copy constructor except it's allowed to invalidate the source argument. C++0x adds another feature which would do exactly what you want: emplace_back. (N3092 §23.2.3) You pass it the arguments to the constructor, then it calls the constructor with those arguments (by ... and forwarding) so no other constructor can ever be invoked. As for C++03, your only option is to add an uninitialized state to your class. Perform actual construction in another function called immediately after push_back. boost::optional might help you avoid initializing members of the class, but it in turn requires they be copy-constructible. Or, as Fred says, accomplish the same thing with initially-empty smart pointers. "
362,"I am creating a WPF app using MVVM. The app manages tagged documents, called Notes, similar to blog posts. A Note has a Title, Text and a Tags collection.

If validation fails, then the Note submission is canceled, the offending control in the UI should get the familair red outline, and a tool tip should explain the error. This all seems pretty straightforward if one wants to validate at the time a WPF control updates its binding source. Just create a custom ValidationRule and add it to the &lt;Binding.ValidationRules&gt; collection.

Thank you in advance, Dennis ","You can do something like this: $(""image_selector_here"").each(function() { if(this.complete) $(this).load(); }); This triggers the load event for cached images (this.complete == true) where the browser isn't firing the .load() event itself.

This works fine: [Authorize(Roles = ""ADMIN"")] Also, I have a base MVC.NET CustomController class that all controllers derive from, and it has a ""currentUser"" property that is auto-fetched from the session on demand, so all controller code just refers to ""currentUser"" and doesn't worry about sessions, httpcontext, etc. I've implemented the membership provider properly, as it works with other parts of the framework that just deals with providers, but until now I had not tried to access the ""User"" principal from a view.

I also have read something about MapReduce and Column oriented tables, big tables, hypertable etc... trying to understand which are the most up to date methods to scale web application data. But the second group, to me, is being hard to understand where it fits. It serves as transactional, reliable data store? or not, its just for large access and processing and to handle fine graned operations we will ever need to rely on RDBMSs? Could someone give a comprehensive landscape for those new technologies and how to use it? ","Basically it's about using the right tool for the job. Relational databases have been around for decades, which means they are very good at solving the problems that haven't changed in that time - things like keeping track of sales for example. Although they have become the default data store for just about everything, they are not so good at handling the problems that didn't exist twenty years ago - particularly scalability and data without a clearly defined, unchanging schema. NOSQL is a class of tools designed to solve the problems that are not perfectly suited to relational databases. Scalability is the best known, though unlikely to be a relevant to most developers. I think the other key use case that we don't see so much of yet is for small projects that don't need to worry about the data storage characteristics at all, and can just use the default - being able to skip database design, ORM and database maintenance is quite attractive. For Ecommerce specifically you're probably better off using sql at least in part - You might use NOSQL for product details or a recommendation engine, but you want your sales data in an easily queried sql table.

393,"I am trying to parse dates in RFC1123 format (Thu, 21 Jan 2010 17:47:00 EST). Here is what I tried but none worked: DateTime Date = DateTime.Parse(dt); DateTime Date = DateTime.ParseExact(dt, ""r"", null); ","Have you tried something like: string dateString, format; DateTime result; CultureInfo provider = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture; dateString = ""Thu, 21 Jan 2010 17:47:00 EST""; format = ""ddd, dd MMM yyyy hh:mm:ss EST""; result = DateTime.ParseExact(dateString, format, provider); Console.WriteLine(""{0} converts to {1}."", dateString, result.ToString()); I haven't tested it yet (will in a few moments)... but I believe that will do it for you. Edit: It seems that the problem is that RFC1123 states that the timezone should always be GMT... which is why r or R did not work as a format for you. The problem is the EST. The pattern above accounts for EST, but it is static so if you have any other timezone you might be in trouble. The best solution would be to go with the RFC1123 standard and go to GMT and it should solve your problem. If you can't, let me know I might have a solution. Edit 2: This is not a complete solution but what it does it isolates the timezone and still allows you to parse it. The code doesn't know the timezone that it is being presented with but you can throw any timezone abbreviation at it and it will parse the time. If you want to convert to GMT and then use r or R you can take the result of the regex match, put it against a lookup table (to see what the time offset it for that timezone abbreviation), then convert the time to GMT and parse from there. That would be a good solution but a little more work. Here's the code: string dateString, format, pattern, tz; DateTime result; CultureInfo provider = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture; pattern = @""[a-zA-Z]+, [0-9]+ [a-zA-Z]+ [0-9]+ [0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+ (?&lt;timezone&gt;[a-zA-Z]+)""; dateString = ""Thu, 21 Jan 2010 17:47:00 EST""; Regex findTz = new Regex(pattern, RegexOptions.Compiled); tz = findTz.Match(dateString).Result(""${timezone}""); format = ""ddd, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss "" + tz; try { result = DateTime.ParseExact(dateString, format, provider); Console.WriteLine(""Timezone format is: {0}"", format); Console.WriteLine(""{0} converts to {1}."", dateString, result.ToString()); } catch (FormatException) { Console.WriteLine(""{0} is not in the correct format."", dateString); } Console.ReadLine(); Here is a list of UTC offsets for you if you would like to turn this into a timezone converter: Timezone Abbreviations with UTC offsets "

399,"I am working through an example in Java Concurrency in Practice and am not understanding why a concurrent-safe container is necessary in the following code. I'm not seeing how the container ""locations"" 's state could be modified after construction; so since it is published through an 'unmodifiableMap' wrapper, it appears to me that an ordinary HashMap would suffice. EG, it is accessed concurrently, but the state of the map is only accessed by readers, no writers. The value fields in the map are syncronized via delegation to the 'SafePoint' class, so while the points are mutable, the keys for the hash, and their associated values (references to SafePoint instances) in the map never change. I think my confusion is based on what precisely the state of the collection is in the problem.

In fact, my production code does exactly what you suggest, and I have asked question on the said mailing list about that code. One of the author of JCiP told me it is okay to use a read-only hashmap for the container. Here is the simplified version (no null check etc.) of my code (I ended up using google-collection's ImmutableMap.) : class Sample { private final ImmutableMap&lt;Long, AtomicReference&lt;Stuff&gt;&gt; container; Sample(){ this.container = getMap(); } void setStuff(Long id, Stuff stuff){ AtomicReference&lt;Stuff&gt; holder = container.get(id); holder.set(stuff); } } It has worked perfectly under extreme load, for an extended time.

The best solution for you would be to change the markup to this... &lt;button id=""myBtn""&gt;TEST&lt;/button&gt; And then assign the click handler programmatically in the same area as your defined function... &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt; //&lt;![CDATA[ jQuery(function($) { function here(b) { alert(b); }; here(6); $(""#myBtn"").click(function() { here(7); }); }); //]]&gt; &lt;/script&gt; Behavioral separation is much better, wouldn't you say?

416,"I am storing date/times in the database as UTC and computing them inside my application back to local time based on the specific timezone. Say for example I have the following date/time: 01/04/2010 00:00 Say it is for a country e.g. UK which observes DST (Daylight Savings Time) and at this particular time we are in daylight savings. When I convert this date to UTC and store it in the database it is actually stored as: 31/03/2010 23:00 As the date would be adjusted -1 hours for DST. This works fine when your observing DST at time of submission. However, what happens when the clock is adjusted back? When I pull that date from the database and convert it to local time that particular datetime would be seen as 31/03/2010 23:00 when in reality it was processed as 01/04/2010 00:00. Correct me if I am wrong but isn't this a bit of a flaw when storing times as UTC? Example of Timezone conversion Basically what I am doing is storing the date/times of when information is being submitted to my system in order to allow users to do a range report. Here is how I am storing the date/times: public DateTime LocalDateTime(string timeZoneId) { var tzi = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(timeZoneId); return TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeFromUtc(DateTime.UtcNow, tzi).ToUniversalTime().ToLocalTime(); } Storing as UTC: var localDateTime = LocalDateTime(""AUS Eastern Standard Time""); WriteToDB(localDateTime.ToUniversalTime()); ","You don't adjust the date for DST changes based on whether you're currently observing them - you adjust it based on whether DST is observed at the instant you're describing. So in the case of January, you wouldn't apply the adjustment. There is a problem, however - some local times are ambiguous. For example, 1:30am on October 31st 2010 in the UK can either represent UTC 01:30 or UTC 02:30, because the clocks go back from 2am to 1am. You can get from any instant represented in UTC to the local time which would be displayed at that instant, but the operation isn't reversible. Likewise it's very possible for you to have a local time which never occurs - 1:30am on March 28th 2010 didn't happen in the UK, for example - because at 1am the clocks jumped forward to 2am. The long and the short of it is that if you're trying to represent an instant in time, you can use UTC and get an unambiguous representation. If you're trying to represent a time in a particular time zone, you'll need the time zone itself (e.g. Europe/London) and either the UTC representation of the instant or the local date and time with the offset at that particular time (to disambiguate around DST transitions). Another alternative is to only store UTC and the offset from it; that allows you to tell the local time at that instant, but it means you can't predict what the local time would be a minute later, as you don't really know the time zone. (This is what DateTimeOffset stores, basically.) We're hoping to make this reasonably easy to handle in Noda Time, but you'll still need to be aware of it as a possibility. EDIT: The code you've shown is incorrect. Here's why. I've changed the structure of the code to make it easier to see, but you'll see it's performing the same calls. var tzi = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(""AUS Eastern Standard Time""); var aussieTime = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeFromUtc(DateTime.UtcNow, tzi); var serverLocalTime = aussieTime.ToLocalTime(); var utcTime = serverLocalTime.ToUniversalTime(); So, let's think about right now - which is 13:38 in my local time (UTC+1, in London), 12:38 UTC, 22:39 in Sydney. Your code will give: aussieTime = 22:39 (correct) serverLocalTime = 23:39 (*not* correct) utcTime = 22:39 (*not* correct) You should not call ToLocalTime on the result of TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeFromUtc - it will assume that it's being called on a UTC DateTime (unless it's actually got a kind of DateTimeKind.Local, which it won't in this case). So if you're accurately saving 22:39 in this case, you aren't accurately saving the current time in UTC. "
417,I'm trying to use mod_rewrite to map multiple domains to different servlets on one host. Example: www.dom1.com -> 192.168.1.n/dom1 www.dom2.com -> 192.168.1.n/dom2 ... I'm using the mod_rewrite and mod_proxy and VirtualHost directive but it seems that the reverse mapping via ProxyPassReverse doesn't work as I expected. ProxyPassReverse /subdomain.domain.com http://192.168.1.n/subdomain doesn't work. I've turned rewrite-logging on with RewriteLog /var/log/rewrite.log From the logs I'd say that rewriting works and the problem seems to be with reverse mapping.

418,"We are on the eve of product launch, and at the last minute I am being bombarded with crash reports that appear to be related to our installer, which is a WiX3 project with separate outputs for x86 and x64 builds. These have been an ongoing problem that I always thought were fixed, only to find out that they were still lurking. The product itself is a collection of binaries that communicate with each other via .Net remoting, including a Windows Service and a small COM component that is loaded as an addon in another app. The service runs as SYSTEM, the COM piece runs in a low-rights context, while the other pieces run in normal user contexts. Other pieces include an third-party COM object library DLL and a shared DLL with the .net Remoting interfaces. I've observed flat-out weird behavior with MSI, particularly on version upgrades. Between MS' anal strong-name implementation (specifically, the exact version check before loading a given assembly), a documented WiX/MSI bug that sees critical files erased on upgrades (essentially, if a file in the upgrade MSI has the same version number as the existing install, that file is deleted)(edit: having trouble producing said documentation...), and having to work around Wow64 virtualization (x86 MSI can only write to registry/HD locations via Wow64, yet x64 MSIs cannot run on x86 computers...), I am about ready to trash the whole thing and port it over to a different install system. What I am looking for on tips + tricks, techniques, or suggestions on how to properly do things so that I am not fighting with Windows Installer's twisted sense of logic. I am tired of fighting with WiX/MSI/Windows Installer. All it needs to do is place files and registry keys where I tell it to, upgrade them when appropriate, and don't delete anything until the user uninstalls. Instead, dependencies are deleted willy-nilly, bringing up a whole bunch of uncatchable exceptions (can't wrap a try{} block around function declarations) and GPF'ing the whole app. I am particularly interested in 'best practices' and examples regarding shared and dependency DLLs, and any tips on making sure if a file needs to go to GAC, that it actually goes to the GAC and stays there until it is appropriate to remove it. Thanks! Tom ","Start off by reading The Definitive Guide to Windows Installer. Done? Great. Now think about scrapping your existing install, starting from scratch and filing an application bug for everything you currently have to ""workaround"" in setup. For nearly every single bit of ""twisted logic"" that you've been fighting with is there for a purpose, to make your installation more reliable and repairable. If you don't want the reliability and resiliency of Windows Installer, or if you're trying to bypass it in any way then use something else. Windows Installer does much, much more than simply just ""place files and registry keys where I tell it to"". When you're writing an MSI package, you define how you want the target system to look. That's the way it looks after setup, the way it should automatically repair to if a file is deleted or a key data file is corrupted. You define how the system should roll back to if a user later cancels during an upgrade from 1.0 to 2.0. Windows Installer is 100% data driven. From a development point of view this is the hardest concept to understand, you can't just edit a config file or write some more data and expect it to persist. Once you get your head around this, Windows Installer becomes a real piece of cake and you design your programs and features to work within it's limitations, rather than trying to break free of them :) A few other useful links...

420,I have a set of .csv files that I want to process. It would be far easier to process it with SQL queries. I wonder if there is some way to load a .csv file and use SQL language to look into it with a scripting language like python or ruby. Loading it with something similar to ActiveRecord would be awesome. The problem is that I don't want to have to run a database somewhere prior to running my script. I souldn't have additionnal installations needed outside of the scripting language and some modules. My question is which language and what modules should I use for this task. I looked around and can't find anything that suits my need. Is it even possible? ,"There's sqlite3, included into python. With it you can create a database (on memory) and add rows to it, and perform SQL queries. If you want neat ActiveRecord-like functionality you should add an external ORM, like sqlalchemy. That's a separate download though Quick example using sqlalchemy: from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, String, Integer, MetaData, Table from sqlalchemy.orm import mapper, create_session import csv CSV_FILE = 'foo.csv' engine = create_engine('sqlite://') # memory-only database table = None metadata = MetaData(bind=engine) with open(CSV_FILE) as f: # assume first line is header cf = csv.DictReader(f, delimiter=',') for row in cf: if table is None: # create the table table = Table('foo', metadata, Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True), *(Column(rowname, String()) for rowname in row.keys())) table.create() # insert data into the table table.insert().values(**row).execute() class CsvTable(object): pass mapper(CsvTable, table) session = create_session(bind=engine, autocommit=False, autoflush=True) Now you can query the database, filtering by any field, etc. Suppose you run the code above on this csv: name,age,nickname nosklo,32,nosklo Afila Tun,32,afilatun Foo Bar,33,baz That will create and populate a table in memory with fields name, age, nickname. You can then query the table: for r in session.query(CsvTable).filter(CsvTable.age == '32'): print r.name, r.age, r.nickname That will automatically create and run a SELECT query and return the correct rows. Another advantage of using sqlalchemy is that, if you decide to use another, more powerful database in the future, you can do so pratically without changing the code. "

424,"I am doing some unit testing stuff in Django. What is the relationship between TestCase class and the actual method in this class? What is the best practice for organizing these stuff?

Which is better and what is the difference? Thanks! "," You rarely write __init__ for a TestCase. So strike that from your mental model of unit testing. You sometimes write a setUp and tearDown. Django automates much of this, however, and you often merely provide a static fixtures= variable that's used to populate the test database. More fundamentally, what's a test case? A test case is a ""fixture"" -- a configuration of a unit under test -- that you can then exercise. Ideally each TestCase has a setUp method that creates one fixture. Each method will perform a manipulation on that fixture and assert that the manipulation worked. However. There's nothing dogmatic about that. In many cases -- particularly when exercising Django models -- where there just aren't that many interesting manipulations. If you don't override save in a model, you don't really need to do CRUD testing. You can (and should) trust the ORM. [If you don't trust it, then get a new framework that you do trust.] If you have a few properties in a models class, you might not want to create a distinct method to test each property. You might want to simply test them sequentially in a single method of a single TestCase. If, OTOH, you have really complex class with lots of state changes, you will need a distinct TestCase to configure an object is one state, manipulate it into another state and assert that the changes all behaved correctly. View Functions, since they aren't -- technically -- stateful, don't match the Unit Test philosophy perfectly. When doing setUp to create a unit in a known state, you're using the client interface to step through some interactions to create a session in a known state. Once the session has reached as desired state, then your various test methods will exercise that session, and assert that things worked. Summary Think of TestCase as a ""Setup"" or ""Context"" in which tests will be run. Think of each method as ""when_X_should_Y"" statement. Some folks suggest that kind of name (""test_when_x_should_y"") So the method will perform ""X"" and assert that ""Y"" was the response. "

432,"i'm playing with MEF and in the example i see this code ( i call it the MEF compose code): var catalog = new AssemblyCatalog(System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()); var container = new CompositionContainer(catalog); container.ComposeParts(); In most examples this is done in the same source file as the Startup Program class lives, as well as all of the other interfaces and classes. Now i want to use the MEF, but i wonder what this container does. As far as i guessed it does the export / import mapping, but what if i have this code (from a windows forms app: [STAThread] static void Main() { Application.Run(new Form1()); } and in that Form1 i want to create an object of type Auditer (which has a property of type ILogger marked import, and i have a class implementing ILogger marked export). Do i have to place the MEF compose code in the void Main(), in the Load event of Form1, or in the constructor of the Auditer class? I only get it to work when i put it (the MEF compose code) in the constructor of the Auditer class, but the examples i read somehow give me the idea that you only have to call the compose code once. ","The CompositionContainer is the class that actually composes your parts in MEF. When you want to use MEF, you need to always compose the part that's attributed with the import definitions. If you have a property in Form1 that's marked with [Import(typeof(ILogger))], at some point, you'll need to compose your Form1 instance. The CompositionContainer is the class that actually performs this composition. It finds the appropriate exported ILogger based off the Catalog(s) contained within the container, and constructs types, matches exports to the imports, etc. The reason that the MEF samples only ""compose"" one time is that, often, with DI, you'll have a single instance of the container constructed and setup at the beginning of the application, and it will compose your ""main"" window. All other classes will be composed automatically if they're being used as part of the main window. (For example, if Form1 composes an ILogger, but your ILogger implementation has an [Import] of it's own, it too will get composed in that pass.) That being said, there is no fixed rule that specifies you can't compose more than once. In WPF and Silverlight, for example, it's frequent that MEF can't construct your object, which means it can't automatically compose your object for you. In these situations, a common pattern is to use the CompositionInitializer (in the box in Silverlight, not in the desktop) to have parts compose themselves, based off a static catalog. I recently blogged about this approach for WPF. With Windows Forms, this may be less necessary, since there isn't a third party product (the XAML parser) constructing your types. However, you could still use this same approach, if you so choose. "

","EDIT: I wrote above answer a long time ago and now I believe that sending 403 is not proper way to go. 403 has slightly different meaning and it just shouldn't be used. This is corrected attribute using 401. It differs only with additional context.HttpContext.Response.End() in Http401Result and different HTTP code: public class OptionalAuthorizeAttribute : AuthorizeAttribute { private class Http401Result : ActionResult { public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context) { // Set the response code to 401. context.HttpContext.Response.StatusCode = 401; context.HttpContext.Response.Write(CTRes.AuthorizationLostPleaseLogOutAndLogInAgainToContinue); context.HttpContext.Response.End(); } } private readonly bool _authorize; public OptionalAuthorizeAttribute() { _authorize = true; } //OptionalAuthorize is turned on on base controller class, so it has to be turned off on some controller. //That is why parameter is introduced. public OptionalAuthorizeAttribute(bool authorize) { _authorize = authorize; } protected override bool AuthorizeCore(HttpContextBase httpContext) { //When authorize parameter is set to false, not authorization should be performed. if (!_authorize) return true; var result = base.AuthorizeCore(httpContext); return result; } protected override void HandleUnauthorizedRequest(AuthorizationContext filterContext) { if (filterContext.RequestContext.HttpContext.Request.IsAjaxRequest()) { //Ajax request doesn't return to login page, it just returns 401 error. filterContext.Result = new Http401Result(); } else base.HandleUnauthorizedRequest(filterContext); } } OLD ANSWER: While I like the ideas posted in other answers (which I had an idea about earlier), I needed code samples. Here they are: Modified Authorize attribute: public class OptionalAuthorizeAttribute : AuthorizeAttribute { private class Http403Result : ActionResult { public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context) { // Set the response code to 403. context.HttpContext.Response.StatusCode = 403; context.HttpContext.Response.Write(CTRes.AuthorizationLostPleaseLogOutAndLogInAgainToContinue); } } private readonly bool _authorize; public OptionalAuthorizeAttribute() { _authorize = true; } //OptionalAuthorize is turned on on base controller class, so it has to be turned off on some controller. //That is why parameter is introduced. public OptionalAuthorizeAttribute(bool authorize) { _authorize = authorize; } protected override bool AuthorizeCore(HttpContextBase httpContext) { //When authorize parameter is set to false, not authorization should be performed. if (!_authorize) return true; var result = base.AuthorizeCore(httpContext); return result; } protected override void HandleUnauthorizedRequest(AuthorizationContext filterContext) { if (filterContext.RequestContext.HttpContext.Request.IsAjaxRequest()) { //Ajax request doesn't return to login page, it just returns 403 error. filterContext.Result = new Http403Result(); } else base.HandleUnauthorizedRequest(filterContext); } } HandleUnauthorizedRequest is overridden, so it returns Http403Result when using Ajax. Http403Result changes StatusCode to 403 and returns message to the user in response. There is some additional logic in attribute (authorize parameter), because I turn on [Authorize] in the base controller and disable it in some pages. The other important part is global handling of this response on client side. This is what I placed in Site.Master: &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt; $(document).ready( function() { $(""body"").ajaxError( function(e,request) { if (request.status == 403) { alert(request.responseText); window.location = '/Logout'; } } ); } ); &lt;/script&gt; I place a GLOBAL ajax error handler and when ever $.post fails with a 403 error, the response message is alerted and the user is redirected to logout page. Now I don't have to handle the error in every $.post request, because it is handled globally. Why 403, and not 401? 401 is handled internally by MVC framework (that is why redirection to login page is done after failed authorization). What do you think about it? "

They make dialog usage much easier (atleast for me), also dialog usage looks more like menu usage. Using these methods, you will also be able to more easilty show the dialog again. I want to give you a tip. It's not an answer to your question, but doing this in an answer is much more readable. Instead of holding a reference to an AlertDialog.Builder() object, you can simply do: new AlertDialog.Builder(this) .setTitle(""Record New Track"") .setMessage(""Please Name Your Track:"") //and some more method calls .create(); //or .show(); Saves you a reference and a lot of typing ;).

In this case you would have to take care that each test method leaves the test data class in exactly the same state it found it, which is not trivial if you want your test case methods to write something in it; this is the reason why unittest try to re-generate the test environment for every test case method.

I know that I did not originally ask for someone to do my homework, and I will accept Alex's answer as it really did answer my question (or confirm my fears). But I promise to upvote any good solutions to my problem here :) EDITEDIT: for reference, a bug has been filed with the kodos project: bug #437633 I'm using Python 2.6.4 (r264:75706, Dec 7 2009, 18:45:15) Thank you for reading this far (If you skipped directly down here, I understand) ","Read your original regex carefully: r""""""(?:/{0,2}\**\s?todo):?\s*(?P&lt;todo&gt;.+)"""""" It matches: zero to two slashes, then 0+ stars, then 0 or 1 ""whitespace characters"" (blanks, tabs etc), then the literal characters 'todo' (and so on). Your rawstring is: r""""""//\todo stuff to fix"""""" so there's a literal backslash between the slashes and the 'todo', therefore of course the regex doesn't match it. It can't -- nowhere in that regex are you expressing any desire to optionally match a literal backslash. Edit: A RE pattern, very close to yours, that would accept and ignore an optional backslash right before the 't' would be: r""""""(?:/{0,2}\**\s?\\?todo):?\s*(?P&lt;todo&gt;.+)"""""" note that the backslash does have to be repeated, to ""escape itself"", in this case.

471,"What I am trying to do is have rows of images, 6 images in each row. Some of these images need to have another image floating on top of them (flush with the lower-right corner). I was able to get that to work from this thread: How do I position one image on top of another in HTML? However, now I'm unable to get the new row after the 6th image. Neither &lt;BR&gt; or &lt;P&gt; create a new line. They simply push the next image down several pixels, but the image is still in the same line. It seems like the float style is interfering with the &lt;BR&gt; and/or &lt;P&gt;.

Image img = Image.FromFile(""mypict.png""); We have a picturebox on the screen we want to draw on. So we have a handler. pictureBox1.Paint += new PaintEventHandler(pictureBox1_Paint); I want our loaded image to be tiled on the picturebox (this is for a game, after all). Why on earth is this code: void pictureBox1_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e) { for (int y = 0; y &lt; 16; y++) for (int x = 0; x &lt; 16; x++) e.Graphics.DrawImage(image, x * 16, y * 16, 16, 16); } over 25 TIMES FASTER than this code: Image buff = new Bitmap(256, 256, PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb); // actually a form member void pictureBox1_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e) { using (Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(buff)) { for (int y = 0; y &lt; 16; y++) for (int x = 0; x &lt; 16; x++) g.DrawImage(image, x * 16, y * 16, 16, 16); } e.Graphics.DrawImage(buff, 0, 0, 256, 256); } To eliminate the obvious, I've tried commenting out the last e.Graphics.DrawImage (which means I don't see anything, but it gets rid a call that isn't in the first example). I've also left in the using block (needlessly) in the first example, but it's still just as blazingly fast. I've set properties of g to match e.Graphics - things like InterpolationMode, CompositingQuality, etc, but nothing I do bridges this incredible gap in performance. I can't find any difference between the two Graphics objects. What gives?

In effect: SELECT Item FROM IDList I LEFT JOIN TABLE T ON I.Item=T.ID WHERE T.ID IS NULL You look like you're OK with building this query on the fly, in which case you can do this with a numbers / tally table by changing the above into SELECT Number FROM (SELECT Number FROM Numbers WHERE Number IN (1,2,3,4)) I LEFT JOIN TABLE T ON I.Number=T.ID WHERE T.ID IS NULL This is relatively prone to SQL Injection attacks though because of the way the query is being built.

479,"Hey, I am trying to make a program that minimises any program to the system tray instead of normally minimising it. Is this possible? I have been looking around on google but cant find anything. ","Icons in the system tray are called ""Notification Icons"". To do this to your own application, If your using WinForms you can use the NotifyIcon class to display icons in the system tray. Then all you have to do it set the window to not be displayed in the task bar. If you're using WPF there isn't a replacement, you still have to use the old WinForms NotifyIcon class, check out this MSDN sample for more information on this. If you want to hide another app, what you need to do is use API calls to make the changes to the state of the applications window. You can use FindWindow to get a handle to the window you want to hide, then you can use GetWindowLong to get the windows state. Then you need to remove the WS_EX_APPWINDOW flag from the state and use the SetWindowLong method to apply the new style, this will remove it from the task bar. You can then use the Get/SetWindowState methods to find out the state of the window and hide/minimise it. You still just need to use the NotifyIcon class to display your own icon in the systray. Good luck with all of that. It's not something I've tried personally, but I've used all these method calls in other ways. If you haven't done API stuff from C# before you might find you need to do a bit of googling to figure out your DllImports for the version API methods. Shouldn't be anything too hard though. Crazyd22 has found a codeproject article that uses a slightly different set of API methods but achieves pretty much the same effect. (See comments below.) "

487,"We have to use delayed_job (or some other background-job processor) to run jobs in the background, but we're not allowed to change the boot scripts/boot-levels on the server. This means that the daemon is not guaranteed to remain available if the provider restarts the server (since the daemon would have been started by a capistrano recipe that is only run once per deployment). Currently, the best way I can think of to ensure the delayed_job daemon is always running, is to add an initializer to our Rails application that checks if the daemon is running. If it's not running, then the initializer starts the daemon, otherwise, it just leaves it be. The question, therefore, is how do we detect that the Delayed_Job daemon is running from inside a script?

489,"Here is the scenario: I have an object called a Transaction that needs to make sure that only one entity has permission to edit it at any given time. In order to facilitate a long-lived lock, I have the class generating a token object that can be used to make the edits. You would use it like this: var transaction = new Transaction(); using (var tlock = transaction.Lock()) { transaction.Update(data, tlock); } Now, I want the TransactionLock class to implement IDisposable so that its usage can be clear. But, I don't have any unmanaged resources to dispose. however, the TransctionLock object itself is a sort of ""unmanaged resource"" in the sense that the CLR doesn't know how to properly finalize it. All of this would be fine and dandy, I would just use IDisposable and be done with it. However, my issue comes when I try to do this in the finalizer: ~TransactionLock() { this.Dispose(false); } I want the finalizer to release the transaction from the lock, if possible. How, in the finalizer, do I detect if the parent transaction (this.transaction) has already been finalized? Is there a better pattern I should be using? Also, the Transaction class itself needn't be disposable, because it doesn't maintain a reference to the lock, and doesn't care whether or not it is unlocked when it goes to the grave. The Transaction class looks something like this: public sealed class Transaction { private readonly object lockMutex = new object(); private TransactionLock currentLock; public TransactionLock Lock() { lock (this.lockMutex) { if (this.currentLock != null) throw new InvalidOperationException(/* ... */); this.currentLock = new TransactionLock(this); return this.currentLock; } } public void Update(object data, TransactionLock tlock) { lock (this.lockMutex) { this.ValidateLock(tlock); // ... } } internal void ValidateLock(TransactionLock tlock) { if (this.currentLock == null) throw new InvalidOperationException(/* ... */); if (this.currentLock != tlock) throw new InvalidOperationException(/* ... */); } internal void Unlock(TransactionLock tlock) { lock (this.lockMutex) { this.ValidateLock(tlock); this.currentLock = null; } } } And the Dispose(bool) code for the TransactionLock: private void Dispose(bool disposing) { if (disposing) { if (this.Transaction != null) { this.Transaction.Unlock(this); this.Transaction = null; } } } ","This was discussed before. Your case is much easier though, you are also implementing the finalizer. That's fundamentally wrong, you are hiding a bug in the client code. Beware that finalizers run on a separate thread. Debugging a consistent deadlock is much easier than dealing with locks that disappear randomly and asynchronously. Recommendation: follow the .NET framework lead: don't help too much. Microsoft abandoned the Synchronized method for the same reason. "

A better approach is to add a call-back method using the DependencyProperty.Register method (there is an overload to add a call-back). Then, that method will be called whenever the value changes, and you can place your logic there. Another question- why are you using OnPropertyChanged? Dependency properties have change notification built-in, you should never have to call OnPropertyChanged for them. "

494,"I'm having trouble getting intellisense to auto-complete shared pointers for boost 1.40.0. (It works fine for Boost 1.33.1.)

Also, auto-completion works fine for boost::scoped_ptr and for boost::shared_array. Any ideas? ","I also recently ran into this and went searching for an answer. All I found was people saying Intellisense is going to be improved in VC10 or that I should improve it now using Visual Assist. I didn't like these answer so I experimented a bit. Here's the solution that fixes most of the issues (at the very least it fixes the issues shared_ptr had that scoped_ptr doesn't). SOLUTION: Change the forward declaration that Intellisense jumps to in exception.hpp to include the template parameter name T. Change template &lt;class&gt; class shared_ptr; To template &lt;class T&gt; class shared_ptr; It seems that Intellisense considers the definition without a template parameter name to be a separate class and this is the root of the difference between shared_ptr and scoped_ptr. Now, I mentioned that this hasn't solved all of my problems. Sometimes templated objects declared in header files don't retain there template type in the cpp files. Ex. // file.h #include &lt;boost/shared_ptr.hpp&gt; struct foo { void funcA() {} }; struct bar { void funcB(); boost::shared_ptr&lt;foo&gt; pfoo; }; and then in the cpp file // file.cpp #include ""file.h"" void bar::funcB() { pfoo.get(); // &lt;-- intellisense does autocomplete after ""pfoo."" pfoo-&gt;func(); // &lt;-- intellisense does not autocomplete after ""pfoo-&gt;"" } Anyways, that's a non tested trimmed down example of an issue we still have but that's far less common so we can live with it until Intellisense improves.

Any one please help!! ,"Guessing you want somthing like this: Black Alert View http://img.skitch.com/20100405-n2ka11en1u63kcpfu6x7et29mc.jpg To achieve this I just subclassed the alert view so I could add a bit of my own code in. I created a background image view that I put a black version of the alert box in. And when drawRect is called I resize the background image view to be the correct height and width. Its a bit of a hack, but it doesn't violate any of the guidelines apple has laid out (I have an app in the store right now using this). To get a good background image I just extracted the images from UI kit (google that and you'll find out how) and just made a black version instead of a blue one. The buttons are actually transparent and pick up what ever colour is under them. So no need to change them. Hope that helps. It is indeed possible. And quite easy as well. All in all about 5 lines of code ;-) Edit: Ask and yee shall receive @implementation BlackAlertView - (void) drawRect:(CGRect) rect { //Force our background image to be the right size. _backgroundImageView.frame = rect; } - (void) dealloc { ReleaseAndNull(_backgroundImageView); [super dealloc]; } - (void)show { UIImage *alertBoxImage = [[UIImage imageNamed:@""UIPopupAlertSheetBackground_black.png""] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:0 topCapHeight:40]; _backgroundImageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:alertBoxImage]; [self addSubview:_backgroundImageView]; [self sendSubviewToBack:_backgroundImageView]; [super show]; } @end Like I said its not purdy, and in reality its a few more then 5 lines.

How can I do that using a .pro file? ","The short answer is: you don't. You should run qmake followed by make in whatever build directory you want to build in. So, run it once in a debug directory, once in a release directory. That's how anyone building your project would expect it to work, and that's how Qt itself is set up to build, that's also how Qt Creator expects your .pro file to behave: it simply starts qmake and then make in the build folder for your target's chosen configuration. If you wish to create these folders and perform the two (or more) builds in them, you'll need a top-level makefile, possibly created from a top-level project file via qmake. It's not uncommon to have more than two build configurations, so you're unnecessarily committing yourself to only differentiating between a build and a release; you might have builds with different optimization levels, etc. The debug/release dichotomy is best left to rest in peace.

508,"I'm currently involved with developing a C# CMS-like web application which will be used to standardise our development of websites. From the outset, the idea has been to keep the core as simple as possible to avoid the complexity and menu/option overload that blights many CMS systems. This simple core is now complete and working very well. We envisisaged that the system would be able to accept plugins or modules which would extend the core functionality to suit a given projects needs. These would also be re-usable across projects. For example, a basic catalogue and shopping basket might be needed. All the code for such extensions should be in seperate assemblies. They should be able to provide their own admin interfaces and front-end code from this library. The system should search for available plugins and give the admin user the option to enable/disable the feature. (This is all very much like WordPress plugins) It is crucial that we attack this problem in the correct way, so I'm trying to perform as much due dilligence as possible before jumping in. I am aware of the Plugin Pattern (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972962.aspx) and have read some articles on it's use. It seems reasonable but I'm not convinced it's necessarily the correct/best technique for this situation. It seems more suited to processing applications (image/audio manipulation, maths etc).

So, I have two questions: What is ISABOUT being replaced with? DO I even NEED any extra SQL Command there? ( IOW, would just putting the search phrase 'Nikon Cameras' be better? ) What I was originally trying to accomplish here was to weight the first word the highest, then the second word lower, and keep descending to 0.5 where I would just rank the remaining words at 0.5. My logic ( and perhaps it's flawed ) was that people's most relevant search words usually happen near the beginning of a phrase ( in English ). Am I going about this the wrong way?

524,"I would like to make (or learn how to make) VST plugins. Is there a special SDK for this? how does one yield a .vst instead of a .exe? Also, if one is looking to make Audio Units for Logic Pro, how is that done? Thanks ","Start with this link to the wiki, explains what they are and gives links to the sdk. Here is some information regarding the deve How to compile a plugin - For making VST plugins in C++Builder, first you need the VST sdk by Steinberg. It's available from the Yvan Grabit's site (the link is at the top of the page). The next thing you need to do is create a .def file (for example : myplugin.def). This needs to contain at least the following lines: EXPORTS main=_main Borland compilers add an underscore to function names, and this exports the main() function the way a VST host expects it. For more information about .def files, see the C++Builder help files. This is not enough, though. If you're going to use any VCL element (anything to do with forms or components), you have to take care your plugin doesn't crash Cubase (or another VST host, for that matter). Here's how: Include float.h. In the constructor of your effect class, write _control87(PC_64|MCW_EM,MCW_PC|MCW_EM); That should do the trick. Here are some more useful sites: http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developer.html how to write a vst plugin (pdf) via http://www.asktoby.com/#vsttutorial "

527,"I'm working on a simple Access 2003 application to keep track of things that need to be done for clients for some colleagues. Each colleague has a set of clients, and each client has a set of actions that need to be taken by a certain date. I've set up a form that consists of a combobox for client ID (indexed), a drop-down for the person who is handling that client's case, and a button for adding new clients (a standard Access-created Add Record button). The actions are listed in a subform below these three elements. The problem I've run into is that the first person I tested this on clicked the button to add a new record, then didn't fill it out and tried to select another client from the drop-down list. Access interprets this as an attempt to set the selected Client ID as the ID for the new record and rightfully throws an error for duplicate primary keys. I can think of a couple of ways around this problem, but I'd much rather hear your elegant solutions than kludge together some junk in a language I don't know. Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you. ",Do not use the same control for data entry and navigating. it is sure to confuse.

530,"This is working, but how??? I have a controller action for a post: [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post )] public ActionResult Edit(Person person) { bool isvalid = ModelState.IsValid; etc. The Person object has a property BirthDate, type DateTime. When i enter some invalid data in the form, say 'blabla' which is obvious not a valid Datetime, it fills all the (other) Person properties with the correct data and the BirthDate property with a new blank DateTime. The bool isvalid has the value 'false'. So far so good. Then i do this: return View(p); and in the view i have this: &lt;%= Html.TextBox(""BirthDate"", String.Format(""{0:g}"", Model.BirthDate)) %&gt; &lt;%= Html.ValidationMessage(""BirthDate"", ""*"") %&gt; Ant there it comes: i EXPECTED the model to contain the new, blank DateTime because i didn't put any new data in. Second, when the View displays something, it must be a DateTime, because Model.BirthDate can't hold anything but a DateTime. But to my surprise, it shows a textbox with the 'blabla' value! (and the red * behind it) Which ofcourse is nice because the user can seee what he typed wrong, but how can that (blabla)string be transferred to the View in a DateTime field? EDIT: The ModelState info helped me a lot here. I also notices that in MVC 2, that when you create your own Template for Html.EditorFor() you have to implement this behaviour yourself. I created a DateTime.ascx in the /views/shared/EditorTemplates folder, and in there i had to check if there was a modelstate error for this property value, and if so, show the invalid data in stead of the Model data. So in the view i use this: &lt;%= Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.DateOfBirth) %&gt; and in the DateTime.ascx i use this: &lt;% bool invalidData = false; string propertyName = ViewData.ModelMetadata.PropertyName; ModelState ms = ViewData.ModelState[propertyName]; if (ms != null) { invalidData = ms.Errors.Count &gt; 0; } string valueToshow = invalidData ?

532,"The setup: Winform/ASP.NET MVC projects. Learning NHibernate SQL-Server driven apps I work with clients that have no idea how to model an application. That's what I'm for. However, we have lots of conflicts with validation, mis-understandings, etc. For example, the client will ask for an order entry screen. The screen should require a ""product"". That's fine and dandy. However, the client didn't know to tell me that the user can't order a product of ""Class A"" unless it's Tuesday. Or, they need a time entry screen. 2 days before it's rolled into production, they casually forgot to mention that certain activities are only valid for certain situations. These situations being a week of coding. That's of course, some crude examples (not by much!). But the problem is getting these non-technical clients to layout their business logic. They somehow didn't realize that the ""Class A"" problem would come up two weeks later, etc. I'm all for agile programming but is there an easy way to somehow make business logic like this extremely easy to implement and change on almost a daily basis? I of course am splitting the project into hopefully intelligent pieces, using NHibernate, etc. But making this BI logic so dynamic is really making it hard to project timelines, etc. Any suggestions? I know there will never be a perfect client (or a perfect provider) but how do you guys deal with the constant mis-understandings? Thanks. ","The problem is that the customer can always come up with some completely left-field ideas. ""Oh, If the customer orders a Class A product on Tuesday, and it happens to be their birthday, give them a 50% discount and a free Class B product. And notify the Chairman to give them a phone call."" You CAN'T program for all eventualities. If you do plan to build a super-duper rules engine for business logic, it should be because your system is going to be widely deployed and needs to be customized by the customers. Not because your customers don't know what they want - in that case you'd be building a system to anticipate customer requirements, not a system to order products (or whatever it's main purpose is). Maybe I’m old-fashioned, or maybe it because I’ve had just too many bad experiences, but I’m not at all interested in agile development. How do you know what direction to travel unless you know where you want to go? For anything more than a small, single function trivial application, I (roughly) follow an iterative Waterfall method, keeping the cycles small. Make sure that you have a complete document of everything that the system will do. Once the client has signed-off on it, that’s what they’re getting. If they have any changes, they all go into “Version 2” which will be started after Version 1 is deployed into production. A little irritating for them, but in the end everyone is a lot happier. Yes, there are always exceptions, like when the management need a data-entry system in 2 days. But then make it clear that if they add any requirements as you go, they’re automatically granting you as much extra time as you need to implement them. "

Why is this so? ","strtok() modifies its input string by overwriting the delimiters with a 0; so, assuming your code looks something like this: char parm[] = ""abc,def""; f1(parm); f1(parm); after the first call to f1, the ',' character is overwritten with a 0, which is a string terminator, so the second call only sees ""abc"" as the string. Note that because strtok() modifies its input, you do not want to pass it a string literal as an argument; attempting to modify the contents of a string literal invokes undefined behavior. The safe thing to do is to create a local string within f1 and copy the contents of names to it, then pass that local string to strtok(). The following should work with C99: void f1(char *name) { size_t len = strlen(name); char localstr[len+1]; char *tmp; strcpy(localstr, name); tmp = strtok(localstr, "" ,""); while(tmp) { ... tmp = strtok(NULL, "" ,""); } } "

My system will comprise of a central management web application where tasks will be defined, and a number of task runners which will be installed on different machines to processes those tasks. What I need to work out is how to distribute the tasks to the clients? Should I just create a queue of tasks, and the task runners constantly poll the queue to see if a new task is ready? What would be the best way to ensure a task is only processed by one task runner? How could I also ensure tasks get evenly distributed between the task runners, so that one task runner doesn't end up processing loads, and other only process a handfull? The only other approach I could think of is that each task runner makes a TCP connection to the server and registers it's interest, then when a new task is ready, the web app chooses a task runner and pushes the task down to that task runner to process? Anybody got any other ideas? pointers? or comments? Many thanks Matt ","A general approach to this problem would be: Implement a set of WCF services that expose the ""task running"" functionality as operations; Deploy the WCF services on several hosts/machines hosted as Windows services (they all must use the same contract); Configure the WCF services to use the Microsoft Message Queuing binding (netMsmqBinding), all using the same queue, in transactional mode; Configure the individual management applications to send their requests to the message queue, using the same netMsmqBinding; Optionally, deploy the management apps/services in a load-balanced network such as an IIS Web Farm (if you want more scalability on the front-end). This is probably the most frictionless approach as you can rely on proven tools to handle the load balancing (IIS/NLB), message security and serialization (WCF), and message delivery and transactional management (MSMQ). Most of the work is already done for you.

541,"I recently got a shiny new development workstation. The only disadvantage of this is that the desktop apps I'm developing now run very, very fast, and so I fear that parts of the code that would be annoyingly slow on end users' machines will go unnoticed during my testing. Is there a good way to slow down an application for testing? I've tried searching around, but all of the results I've been able to find seem pretty fiddly to set up (e.g., manually setting up a high-priority CPU-bound task on the same CPU core as the target app, or running a background process that rapidly interrupts and resumes the target app), and I don't know if the end result is actually a good representation of running on a slower computer (with its slower CPU, slower RAM, slower disk I/O...). I don't think that this is a job for a profiler; I'm interested in the user's perception of end-to-end performance rather than in where the time goes for particular operations. ","Personally, I'd get an old used crappy computer that is typical of what the users have and test on that. It should be cheap and you will see pretty fast how bad things are. "

547,"idea I would like to create a little app for myself to store ideas (the thing is - I want it to do MY WAY) database I'm thinking going simple: id - unique id of revision in database text_id - identification number of text rev_id - number of revision flags - various purposes - expl. later title - self expl. desc - description text - self expl . flags - if I (i.e.) add flag rb;65, instead of storing whole text, I just said, that whenever I ask for latest revision, I go again in DB and check revision 65 Question: Is this setup the best? Is it better to store the diff, or whole text (i know, space is cheap...)? Does that revision flag make sense (wouldn't it be better to just copy text - more disk space, but less db and php processing. php I'm thinking, that I'll go with PEAR here. Although main point is to open-edit-save, possiblity to view revisions can't be that hard to program and can be life-saver in certain situations (good ideas got deleted, saving wrong version, etc...). However, I've never used PEAR in a long-time or full-project relationship, however, brief encounters in my previous experience left rather bad feeling - as I remember, it was too difficult to implement, slow and humongous to play with, so I don't know, if there's anything better. Update: It seems, that there are more text diff pre-made libraries, some even more light-weight than PEAR, so I'll have to dig into it, probably. why? Although there are bazillions of various time/project/idea management tools, everything lacks something for me, whether it's sharing with users, syncing on more PCs, time-tracking, project management... And I believe, that this text diff webapp will be for internal use with various different tools later. So if you know any good and nice-UI-having project management app with support for text-heavy usage, just let me know, so I'll save my time for something better than redesigning the weel. ","I think your question is just boiling down to the one line (If there's something else, let me know, and I'll add on): Is it better to store the diff, or whole text (i know, space is cheap...)? It's definitely better to store the whole text, unless you really need to save space. Viewing the text will be a much more common action than checking a diff, and if something has a lot of revisions it could be a significant process to ""build"" the text for the latest one. Imagine a heavily-used page where you've done thousands of revisions, and the ""whole text"" is only stored with the original. Then you have to process thousands of diffs just to view the latest text, instead of just pulling it straight out of the database. If you want to compromise, every time you calculate a diff between any two revisions, store it in a separate table. Then you only have to calculate any given diff once, so it'll be instant the next time you view the same diff. If necessary, this table could be pruned every once in a while to remove diffs that haven't been accessed in a long time. "

If another user was executing the same query, it might obtain shared locks on the same page at the same time another user does. Then when one tries to upgrade to an exclusive lock, it will wait for all other shared locks to be released. The other will also be waiting for all shared locks to be released. Both will have a shared lock and waiting for the other to release that shared lock so itself can obtain an exclusive lock. Other queries will pile up trying to do the same, and soon the deadlocks will begin to be detected and the queries will begin to get cancelled and rolled back. Depending on the frequency of the queries the dead lock detection of the DB engine may not be killing off queries as fast as new ones are coming in, meaning none of the queries will succeed. You would need to add something like a hint in the select to request that an exclusive lock be obtained from the get-go.

570,"I'm reading a text file via CGI in, in perl, and noticing that when the file is saved in mac's textEdit the line separator is recognized, but when I upload a CSV that is exported straight from excel, they are not. I'm guessing it's a \n vs. \r issue, but it got me thinking that I don't know how to specify what I would like the line terminator token to be, if I didn't want the one it's looking for by default. ","Yes. You'll want to overwrite the value of $/. From perlvar $/ The input record separator, newline by default. This influences Perl's idea of what a ""line"" is. Works like awk's RS variable, including treating empty lines as a terminator if set to the null string. (An empty line cannot contain any spaces or tabs.) You may set it to a multi-character string to match a multi-character terminator, or to undef to read through the end of file. Setting it to ""\n\n"" means something slightly different than setting to """", if the file contains consecutive empty lines. Setting to """" will treat two or more consecutive empty lines as a single empty line. Setting to ""\n\n"" will blindly assume that the next input character belongs to the next paragraph, even if it's a newline. (Mnemonic: / delimits line boundaries when quoting poetry.) local $/; # enable ""slurp"" mode local $_ = &lt;FH&gt;; # whole file now here s/\n[ \t]+/ /g; Remember: the value of $/ is a string, not a regex. awk has to be better for something. :-) Setting $/ to a reference to an integer, scalar containing an integer, or scalar that's convertible to an integer will attempt to read records instead of lines, with the maximum record size being the referenced integer. So this: local $/ = \32768; # or \""32768"", or \$var_containing_32768 open my $fh, ""&lt;"", $myfile or die $!; local $_ = &lt;$fh&gt;; will read a record of no more than 32768 bytes from FILE. If you're not reading from a record-oriented file (or your OS doesn't have record-oriented files), then you'll likely get a full chunk of data with every read. If a record is larger than the record size you've set, you'll get the record back in pieces. Trying to set the record size to zero or less will cause reading in the (rest of the) whole file. On VMS, record reads are done with the equivalent of sysread, so it's best not to mix record and non-record reads on the same file. (This is unlikely to be a problem, because any file you'd want to read in record mode is probably unusable in line mode.) Non-VMS systems do normal I/O, so it's safe to mix record and non-record reads of a file. See also ""Newlines"" in perlport. Also see $.. "

572,"I'm writing some coordinate transformations (more specifically the Joukoswky Transform, Wikipedia Joukowsky Transform), and I'm interested in performance, but of course precision. I'm trying to do the coordinate transformations in two ways: 1) Calculating the real and complex parts in separate, using double precision, as below: double r2 = chi.x*chi.x + chi.y*chi.y; //double sq = pow(r2,-0.5*n) + pow(r2,0.5*n); //slow!!! double sq = sqrt(r2); //way faster! double co = cos(atan2(chi.y,chi.x)); double si = sin(atan2(chi.y,chi.x)); Z.x = 0.5*(co*sq + co/sq); Z.y = 0.5*si*sq; where chi and Z are simple structures with double x and y as members. 2) Using complex : Z = 0.5 * (chi + (1.0 / chi)); Where Z and chi are complex . There interesting part is that indeed the case 1) is faster (about 20%), but the precision is bad, giving error in the third decimal number after the comma after the inverse transform, while the complex gives back the exact number. So, the problem is on the cos(atan2), sin(atan2)? But if it is, how the complex handles that? EDIT: Just figured out that this was not exactly the question that I had in mind. I have to do the general transformation, as Z = 1/2*(chi^n + (1/chi)^n), and so far the code above was the way I've figured to do it. More precisely, double sq = pow(sqrt(r2),n); //way faster! double co = cos(n*atan2(chi.y,chi.x)); double si = sin(n*atan2(chi.y,chi.x)); Z.x = 0.5*(co*sq + co/sq); Z.y = 0.5*(si*sq - sq/si); Also correcting the bug on Z.y.

I have to do this to support two different clients, but I don't want to have entirely different controller actions for both. So, I am trying to come up with a way to use a strongly typed model with validation attributes but have some of these attributes be conditional. Some approaches I can think of is similar to steve sanderson's partial validation approach. Where I would clear the model errors in a filter OnActionExecuting based on which version of the form was active. The other approach I was thinking of would to break the model up into pieces using something like class FormModel { public Form1 Form1Model {get; set;} public Form2 FormModel {get; set;} } and then find some way to just validate the appropriate property depending on the version. There would also be common properties on the model that apply to both which would be always validated. Does anyone have a good suggestion on this? ","I've had reasonable success with using ModelBinders to remove errors I don't need from the ModelState. Here's an example for an Address model binder. In the UI I have a &lt;SELECT&gt; for US States, but this is hidden when the country is not 'US' in favor of a &lt;INPUT ID=StateOrProvince&gt; textbox. The modelbinder looks at the country and removes the unneeded values. As far as doing this with validation attributes - I'd think you'd quickly get yourself in a big mess unless you have very simple rules. Tip: You can have as many modelbinders as you want to discreet pieces of your overall model. For instance - I have 2 Address objects in my model and they each automatically get this behavior applied. Register: ModelBinders.Binders[typeof(UI.Address)] = new AddressModelBinder(); ModelBinder: public class AddressModelBinder : DefaultModelBinder { protected override void OnModelUpdated(ControllerContext controllerContext, ModelBindingContext bindingContext) { base.OnModelUpdated(controllerContext, bindingContext); // get the address to validate var address = (Address)bindingContext.Model; // remove statecd for non-us if (address.IsUSA) { address.StateOrProvince = string.IsNullOrEmpty(address.StateCd) ? null : CountryCache.GetStateName(address.StateCd); bindingContext.ModelState.Remove(bindingContext.ModelName + "".StateOrProvince""); } else { address.StateCd = null; bindingContext.ModelState.Remove(bindingContext.ModelName + "".StateCd""); } // validate US zipcode if (address.CountryCode == ""US"") { if (new Regex(@""^\d{5}([\-]\d{4})?$"", RegexOptions.Compiled).Match(address.ZipOrPostal ?? """").Success == false) { bindingContext.ModelState.AddModelError(bindingContext.ModelName + "".ZipOrPostal"", ""The value "" + address.ZipOrPostal + "" is not a valid zipcode""); } } // all other modelbinding attributes such as [Required] will be processed as normal } } "

I have tried adding various attributes to the IWidget interface (XmlIgnore, SoapIgnore, NonSerialized), but they are not valid on an interface.

Are there any ways around this apart from removing the IWidget interface from the WidgetVersion1 and WidgetVersion2 class definitions? ","WCF can't serialize an interface either; in fact, it's impossible to serialize an interface over SOAP. The reason (simplified) is that, when deserializing, .NET has to be able to create some actual concrete class. An interface is an abstract concept; there always has to be a ""real"" class implementation behind it in order for an actual instance to exist. Since you can't construct a physical instance of an interface, it also can't be serialized. If you're trying to use the XmlIgnoreAttribute, understand that applying it to the type won't accomplish anything. It needs to be applied to the member instead. In other words: public class SerializableClass { [XmlElement] public int ID { get; set; } [XmlElement] public string Name { get; set; } [XmlIgnore] public IMyInterface Intf { get; set; } } ...will serialize OK, because the serializer won't try to serialize the Intf property.

For example: &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt; window.onload = function() { document.getElementById( 'form_with_hidden_fields' ).submit(); } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;form method=""POST"" action=""realquery"" id=""form_with_hidden_fields""&gt; &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""foo"" value=""1"" /&gt; ... &lt;/form&gt; Please wait while your query is processed... If you're interested in an AJAX solution, here's an example using jQuery: $( '#submit-button' ).click( function() { // show a ""please wait"" image $( '#status-div' ).html( '&lt;img src=""please_wait.gif"" /&gt;' ); // animated gif // get form values var formdata = { foo: $( 'input#foo' ).val(), ... }; // submit form via ajax: $.ajax( { type: ""POST"", url: ""/realquery"", data: formdata, success: function() { $( '#status-div' ).html( '&lt;img src=""success.gif"" /&gt;' ); } ); } ); And you could attach that to a form like: &lt;form&gt; &lt;input type=""text"" name=""foo"" id=""foo"" /&gt; &lt;input type=""submit"" id=""submit-button"" /&gt; &lt;div id=""status-div""&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/form&gt; The empty status-div div will receive an image tag that points to a ""please wait"" image (this can be an animated gif). When the Ajax query finishes, it's replaced by a ""success"" image. "
596,"I have a C++ project, where 1 method of a 1 class changes very often. So I want to take that code from C++ to Lua. Note, I'm novice to Lua. The whole task: Bind some class methods to Lua state machine; Pass reference to class object to a function, written in Lua; Operate with passed C++ object in Lua function. I've found how to make first step with Lunar, and can't cope with second and third. I can't use SWIG and boost. ","//This has a large number of steps, but I'm gonna post them all. This is all using native Lua 5 and the lua CAPI. int CreateInstanceOfT(lua_State* L) { new (lua_newuserdata(L, sizeof(T))) T(constructor args); return 1; } int CallSomeFuncOnT(lua_State* L) { if (lua_istable(L, 1)) { // If we're passed a table, get CData lua_getfield(L, 1, ""CData""); lua_replace(L, 1); } if (!lua_touserdata(L, 1)) lua_error(L); // longjmp out. T&amp; ref = *(T*)lua_touserdata(L, 1); ref.SomeFunc(); // If you want args, I'll assume that you can pass them yourself return 0; } int main() { lua_State* L = luaL_newstate(); lua_pushcfunction(L, CreateInstanceOfT); lua_setglobal(L, ""CreateInstanceOfT""); lua_pushcfunction(L, CallSomeFuncOnT); lua_setglobal(L, ""CallSomeFuncOnT""); luaL_dofile(L, ""something.lua""); lua_close(L); } -- Accompanying Lua code: semicolons are optional but I do out of habit.

I could post a great quantity of detail about how to make exposure easier, and how to make inheritance, and suchlike - and it'll need altering if you want to expose more than one T (I think the most common solution is a simple struct { std::auto_ptr&lt;void&gt;, int type } deal). But, it should be a starting point if you don't understand anything about this process. Bascally, first, we ask Lua to allocate some space (the userdata), then put T in it. When CallSomeFuncOnT comes up, first we ask it if we have a table (many Lua classes are based around tables, as they support object orientation, metatables, and such), and get the userdata out, which we then convert into a pointer to our object, and then convert into a reference. Remember that lua_touserdata gives you a void*, so you'd better be damn sure about what's on the other end. Then we call somefunc and return. In Main, we just register the functions as globals. Now, in Lua, when you call CreateInstanceOfT, it effectively just calls the T constructor, transparently to the Lua user. Then we ditch it in a table, which is simpler for Lua novices, and call SomeFunc by passing it this table. "
597,"I have a couple of columns in jqGrid with edittype=""select"". How can I read the option value of the value currently selected in a particular row? e.g.: When I provide the following option, how do I get ""FE"" for FedEx, etc. editoption: { value: “FE:FedEx; IN:InTime; TN:TNT” } getRowData() for the rowId/cellname returns only the text/displayed component of the select. If I set a ""change"" data event on the column, the underlying fires change events only on mouse clicks, and not keyboard selects (there's numerous references to generic selects and mouse/keyboard issues). Bottomline, when a new value is selected, I need to know the option value at the time of the change, and also prior to posting to the server. ","The documentation for getRowData states: Do not use this method when you editing the row or cell. This will return the cell content and not the actuall value of the input element Is the row still being edited when you call getRowData()?

602,"I'm writing a server running as a Windows service that by request invokes Firefox to generate a pdf snapshot of a webpage. I know it is a bad idea to run a GUI program in service mode, but the server nature of my program restricts from running it in the user mode. Running a user-level 'proxy' also is not an option, since there might be no interactive user logged-in on the machine with the server running. In my experiments Firefox successfully produced pdf when the service was running under a user account that was already logged-in. Obviously it didn't work in other cases: for Local System and user accounts that weren't logged-in. Under LocalSystem with 'Allow service to interact with desktop' option enabled I could see the Firefox started that reports that it's unable to find a printer. Since it wouldn't be practical to require an opened user session for the pdf server to run, is there any workaround for this except running the whole thing from a virtual machine? UPDATE: I figured that the problem wasn't really with account permissions, but with an invisible modal dialog that FF was waiting on while running in the service mode. However it's still unable to create a pdf when FF is running under the LocalSystem account. FF says it can't find a printer and I'm wondering if this is a permission that could be somehow enabled?

605,"This seems like a simple problem: I have a WF4 activity that guides the user through a set of questions. After each question is displayed, the activity should be idled until the question is answered. After each question is answered, I want to prompt the user with the next question. (The next question is determined based on the answer to the previous question.) To do this, I have a simple workflow activity that implements a Bookmark. I have a console app running the workflow using WorkflowApplication.Run, waiting for input, and then calling .ResumeBookmark. What I need to do is to get the value of Current_Question_Text from the workflow when it becomes idle. I've set the WorkflowApplication.Idle property to a delegate and in that delegate, I'd like to get the text of the current question stored within the Activity. However, the output arguments are not available until the Completed method fires and the WorkflowApplicationIdleEventArgs don't provide any information about the current state of data. I've also looked at the Activity and WorkflowApplication variables in the Idle delegate and cannot see any way to get to the data that way. Is there anyway to get data values from the Activity while it is idle? Thanks, David Burgett ",There are a couple of ways you can do this. What works best depends on the circumstances. Explicitly save the variable to some external place like a database and have the client read it from there. Easy to do using a custom activity but adds another disconnect to your application. Use workflow persistence and property promotion to extract the value and store it in the workflow instance store. The promoted properties are not the nicest to work with and it requires using a WorkflowInstanceStore. Also the value is only updated when the workflow is persisted. Using a custom workflow tracking extension and extracting the value using a ActivityStateQuery. I suspect this would be the easiest approach to take in a lot of cases.

I have extensive experience with MySQL but a social app offers complexities which MySQL is not well suited too. I know Facebook, Twitter etc have moved towards Cassandra for a lot of their data but I am not sure how far to go with it. For example would you store such things as user data - username, passwords, addresses etc in Cassandra? Would you store e-mails, comments, status updates etc in Cassandra? I have also read alot that something like neo4j is much better for representing the friend relationships used by social apps as it is a graph database. I am only just starting down the NoSQL route so any guidance is greatly appreciated. Would anyone be able to advise me on this? I hope I am not being too general! "," For example would you store such things as user data - username, passwords, addresses etc in Cassandra? No, since it does not guarantee consistency. Cassandra is eventually consistent. Surely there shouldn't be concurrency on a certain user account's data, but I wouldn't want to bet on it. You might not need consistency on your fulltext search, your message inbox, etc. but you want consistency in anything that is security-related.

I'm a big fan of the right tool for the right job. I haven't used neo4j but I've been using db4o (which is an object database) and find it very helpful. It makes development easier to use a tool that natively supports your needs. Since you need graphs and working with graphs in SQL is a pain, I'd recommend to give it a look, and evaluate whether it fits your specific needs. Mixing databases sounds like a good idea to me as long as the choice is natural (i.e. the respective database is helpful with the specific jobs, a graph databases for graphs, a table for tables, ACID databases for anything that needs transaction safety, etc...).

In this case, I think you'd be able to get away with simply: Mapper.CreateMap&lt;RegionOfInterest, RegionOfInterestData&gt;(); Mapper.CreateMap&lt;Camera, CameraData&gt;(); And later on: CameraData cd = Mapper.Map&lt;Camera, CameraData&gt;(camera); This not only reduces the code churn but compartmentalizes the mapping code in its own ""mapping layer"" - you have one or several modules that register these mappings that you can put in whichever assembly really uses the DTOs. And of course you can always create extension methods to simplify the actual mapping: public static class CameraExtensions { public static CameraData ToCameraData(this Camera camera) { return Mapper.Map&lt;Camera, CameraData&gt;(camera); } } Which makes the whole thing as simple as writing camera.ToCameraData(), but without creating a hard dependency between the domain object (Camera) and the DTO (CameraData). You have basically all of the ease-of-use of your original version, but without the coupling. If you're creating these dependencies because you're trying to create the CameraData object from private Camera data which isn't exposed publicly then my immediate reaction would be, something's not quite right about this design. Why not expose read-only properties on the Camera object? If you're giving the outside world access to them anyway, through the ToData method, then you're clearly not hiding this information, you're just making it more cumbersome to get to. What if you decide 3 months down the road that you need a different kind of DTO? You shouldn't have to modify your domain-centric Camera object every time you want to support a new use case. Better, in my opinion, to put a few read-only public properties in the class so that mappers can get access to the attributes they need. "

624,"According to the responses in ""Why subtract null pointer in offsetof()?"" (and my reading of K&amp;R), the C standard doesn't require that (size_t)((char *)0) == 0. Still, I've never seen a situation where casting a null pointer to an integer type evaluates to anything else. If there is a compiler or scenario where (size_t)((char *)0) != 0, what is it? ","Well, as you know, the physical representation of null pointer of a given type is not necessarily all-zero bit pattern. When you forcefully convert a pointer (any pointer) value to integer type, the result is implementation defined, but normally (and that's the intent) the numerical value of the pointer - the numerical address - remains unchanged, if possible. This means that if on a given platform a null pointer of type char * is represented by 0xBAADF00D pattern (for example), the above expression will evaluate to 0xBAADF00D, and not to zero. Of course, for that you'd need a platform with non-zero null-pointers. I personally never worked with such platforms, although I heard about a number of real platforms like that out there (like, in the realm of embedded platforms it is not something unusual). Moreover, as an additional note, null pointer values of different types can have different physical representations, meaning that in theory you can get different values from (size_t) ((int *) 0), (size_t) ((char *) 0) and (size_t) ((double *) 0). But that would be a rather exotic situation, albeit perfectly possible from the point of view of abstract C language. P.S. Read here (C FAQ) for some examples of actual platforms with non-zero null pointers. "
625,"I hope this question is clear enough -- if not let me know :) What API would I use when I want to write a procedure at runtime and then just run it eventually at low priority while continuing to do the important stuff right now? Example: link checker 1. I write a blog post with links represented by Link objects. I publish the post. 2. Eventually (at very low priority) the system gets around to fetching the URL of each Link object to make sure it's not broken and indicates that in a property of the Link object. 3. When a user visits my blog post, the render code that turns Link objects into HTML knows whether the links have been checked.

One nice thing about the RadComboBox (their full-featured drop down list for ASP.NET) is that it allows you to override the rendering of every item in the list if you wish. By overriding the rendering of each item, you may put any kind of HTML into the drop down list (including images, tables, etc). So it is pretty powerful. The down-side is that it is a commercial product and there is a bit of a learning curve. Also, Telerik controls can be a little heavy depending upon your requirements.

The client opens port 80 of their firewall and we display a login page (OpenID IdP) which establishes a secure connection with our OpenID RP located on our server.

638,"Something that has piqued my interest is Objective-C's BOOL type definition. Why is it defined as a signed char (which could cause unexpected behaviour if a value greater than 1 byte in length is assigned to it) rather than as an int, as C does (much less margin for error: a zero value is false, a non-zero value is true)? The only reason I can think of is the Objective-C designers micro-optimising storage because the char will use less memory than the int. Please can someone enlighten me?

644,"I had a Invalid Cross Thread access issue, but a little research and I managed to fix it by using the Dispatcher. Now in my app I have objects with lazy loading. I'd make an Async call using WCF and as usual I use the Dispatcher to update my objects DataContext, however it didn't work for this scenario. I did however find a solution here. Here's what I don't understand. In my UserControl I have code to call an Toggle method on my object. The call to this method is within a Dispatcher like so. Dispatcher.BeginInvoke( () =&gt; _CurrentPin.ToggleInfoPanel() ); As I mentioned before this was not enough to satisfy Silverlight. I had to make another Dispatcher call within my object. My object is NOT a UIElement, but a simple class that handles all its own loading/saving. So the problem was fixed by calling Deployment.Current.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke( () =&gt; dataContext.Detail = detail ); within my class. Why did I have to call the Dispatcher twice to achieve this? Shouldn't a high-level call be enough? Is there a difference between the Deployment.Current.Dispatcher and the Dispatcher in a UIElement? ","Ideally, store a single instance of Dispatcher that you can use elsewhere without having the thread check on it. Calling any singleton .Current instance may in fact cause a cross-thread access check to be invoked. By storing it first, you can avoid this to actually get the shared instance. I use a ""SmartDispatcher"" that uses a dispatcher when called off-thread, and just invokes otherwise. It solves this sort of issue.

645,"I'm printing a variable say z1 which is a 1-D array containing floating point numbers to a text file so that I can import into Matlab or GNUPlot for plotting. I've heard that binary files (.dat) are smaller than .txt files. The definition that I currently use for printing to a .txt file is: void create_out_file(const char *file_name, const long double *z1, size_t z_size){ FILE *out; size_t i; if((out = _fsopen(file_name, ""w+"", _SH_DENYWR)) == NULL){ fprintf(stderr, ""***&gt; Open error on output file %s"", file_name); exit(-1); } for(i = 0; i &lt; z_size; i++) fprintf(out, ""%.16Le\n"", z1[i]); fclose(out); } I have three questions: Are binary files really more compact than text files?; If yes, I would like to know how to modify the above code so that I can print the values of the array z1 to a binary file. I've read that fprintf has to be replaced with fwrite. My output file say dodo.dat should contain the values of array z1 with one floating number per line. I have %.16Le up in my code but I think that %.15Le is right as I have 15 precision digits with long double. I have put a dot (.) in the width position as I believe that this allows expansion to an arbitrary field to hold the desired number. Am I right? As an example with %.16Le, I can have an output like 1.0047914240730432e-002 which gives me 16 precision digits and the width of the field has the right width to display the number correctly. Is placing a dot (.) in the width position instead of a width value a good practice? Thanks a lot... UPDATE Is changing to: for(i = 0; i &lt; z_size; i++) fwrite(&amp;z1, sizeof(long double), 1, out); ok in addition to the change to ""wb+"" ? I can't read the binary file in Matlab. "," yes, binary files are more compact, but you lose portability and there are various other potential problems too, so unless your data files are problematically huge, or slow to export/import, it's a good idea to stick with text if you can (you can always compress them for storage, e.g. with zip) open you file with ""wb"" instead of ""w"" and use fwrite() - you no longer have ""lines"" in your file - it will just be a stream of (binary) floating point values you may be getting confused between double and long double - a long double can be up to 16 bytes in size and have a precision of up to around 32 digits (however this is implementation-dependent - long double can commonly be 10, 12 or 16 bytes). A double is usually 8 bytes and has a precision of around 16 digits. MATLAB may not be able to cope with long double (as it is not well standardized) so you probably just want to write doubles to your data file, e.g. for (i = 0; i &lt; z_size; i++) { double z = (double)z1[i]; fwrite(&amp;z, sizeof(double), 1, out); } "

648,I have an entity with a transient field. When I want to create a new instance of the object I lose my transient information. The following example demonstrates the issue. For the sake of the example let's say that barness is a transient field. FooEntity fooEntity = new FooEntity(); fooEntity.setFoobosity(5); fooEntity.setBarness(2); fooEntity = fooEntityManager.merge(fooEntity); System.out.println(fooEntity.getFoobosity()); //5 System.out.println(fooEntity.getBarness()); //0 (or whatever default barness is) Is there any way to maintain my transient information? ,"This is, more or less, working as designed. The semantics of transient are precisely that the data is not persisted. The entity returned from entityManager.merge(obj) is, in fact, an entirely new entity that maintains the state of the object passed into merge (state, in this context, being anything that is not part of the persistent object). This is detailed in the JPA spec. Note: There may be JPA implementations that do maintain the transient field after the object is merged (simply because they return the same object), but this behavior is not guaranteed by the spec. There are essentially two things you can do: Decide to persist the transient field. It doesn't really seem to be transient if you need it after merging the class into the persistence context. Maintain the value of the transient field outside of the persistent object. If this is what meets your needs, you may want to rethink the structure of your domain class; if this field is not part of the state of the domain object it really shouldn't be there. One final thing: the main use case I've found for transient fields on domain classes is to demarcate derived fields, i.e., fields that can be recalculated based on the persistent fields of the class.

650,"I have the following code in a production application which calculates a GMT date from the date the user enters: NSDate *localDate = pickedDate; NSTimeInterval timeZoneOffset = [[NSTimeZone defaultTimeZone] secondsFromGMT]; // You could also use the systemTimeZone method NSTimeInterval gmtTimeInterval = [localDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate] - timeZoneOffset; NSDate *gmtDate = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceReferenceDate:gmtTimeInterval]; The code was working fine, until the dreaded daylight savings time came into force in the UK last week. How can I convert the date into GMT whilst taking into account daylight savings? ","NSDate uses an offset from an absolute value to represent time intervals. The basis is in GMT and all time intervals are in GMT, which is why you see the difference. If you want a string representation of your date (like for storing in a database or whatever), use the NSDateFormatter to create it in whichever specific time zone you need. So, this will always give you a string representation (like for storing in mysql) of the date in GMT (with daylights savings times accounted for): NSDateFormatter* formatter = [[[NSDateFormatter alloc] init] autorelease]; [formatter setDateFormat:@""YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss""]; // e.g., set for mysql date strings [formatter setTimeZone:[NSTimeZone timeZoneWithAbbreviation:@""GMT""]]; NSString* mysqlGMTString = [formatter stringFromDate:[NSDate date]]; This will give you the proper date string in GMT time regardless of the local time zone. Also, keep in mind that all relative measurements that you do with NSDate and time intervals have their basis in GMT. Use date formatters and calendar objects to convert them to more meaningful things when you present them to the user or if you need to do calendar calculations (e.g., displaying a warning that your subscription expires tomorrow). EDIT: I forgot to add the time zone! Without it the formatter will use the system time zone. "

For every http request, graphical resources incuding (all images on the site) a transaction is created and that seems to delay the loading times (without the transactions loading times per one image are ~1-10 ms with transactions they are over 1 second). What is the proper way to manage transactions in ASP.NET MVC + NH stack? When i've put all transactions into my repository methods, for some obscure reasons I got 'implicit transactions' warning in NHProf (the SQL statements were executed outside transaction, even that in code session.Save()/Update()/etc methods were invoked within transaction 'using' scope and before transaction.Commit() call) BTW are implicit transactions really bad? ","You need to use a contextual session so that a new session and transaction are not created on every request for an image resource, etc. See my answer to this question. This change should improve performance significantly. This is probably also the root cause of the implicit transaction warnings. Another frequent performance issue with NH applications is using log4net with a DEBUG level. Edit: Min and Kevin Pang's answers are also good advice so I won't bother repeating their statements. "

But then any if statements with the condition if(hour == 0) are not evaluated. Likewise, this would not be evaluated either: if(hour &lt; 1). The code above puts the hour int into another int, selectedHour (don't worry about why I'm doing this for now), but selectedHour suffers from the same weird behavior; the if(selectedHour &lt;= 0) line is never evaluated. Am I going crazy, or am I just an idiot? Maybe there's some behavior of 0 integers that I'm not aware of. All of my code runs fine as long as it's not 12:XX AM. ","It was a problem with my Xcode installation oddly enough. Just reinstalled everything and it's working correctly now.

653,"Is there such a thing as JspC in the Seam/JSF/Facelets world?

And I think bugs like these can be caught using a program. Just wondering if someone has already written one. Basically a tool that can validate if the method/value binding are correct.

Like I've told a million other people, you can't use divisions inside a table without getting some adverse effects that you just can't fix, they're not meant to be there. My guess is that right: -30px is being interpreted to add 30px to the right side to make room for it. Just floating the images to the right will be a much better solution though, and you can add a margin around them to space them properly. Also, you are supposed to float anything to the right FIRST, not after the content. Most browsers will usually put content floated to the right on a new line if it's after the content, that is proper behavior. This is because by default a division will start a new line on its own, then it will be modified to float to the right, usually on the same new line it created already. So yeah, there are a few different things that are causing problems. It's not one thing causing every problem, though. "

660,"Usually I save documents (images, mpegs, excel, word docs, etc...) for my friends or family on my website's root, inside a directory called /files/ or something similar. Nothing too uncommon. But, I have been playing with user session control, and allowing users to upload files to the dedicated /files/ directory. (the file names are saved in a db, with that user's ID) But, that means other people could try to guess and locate other people's files. I do randomize the file names, upon upload.

663,"I'm writing some software that modifies a Windows Server's configuration (things like MS-DNS, IIS, parts of the filesystem). My design has a server process that builds an in-memory object graph of the server configuration state and a client which requests this object graph. The server would then serialize the graph, send it to the client (presumably using WCF), the server then makes changes to this graph and sends it back to the server. The server receives the graph and proceeds to make modifications to the server. However I've learned that object-graph serialisation in WCF isn't as simple as I first thought. My objects have a hierarchy and many have parametrised-constructors and immutable properties/fields. There are also numerous collections, arrays, and dictionaries. My understanding of WCF serialisation is that it requires use of either the XmlSerializer or DataContractSerializer, but DCS places restrictions on the design of my object-graph (immutable data seems right-out, it also requires parameter-less constructors). I understand XmlSerializer lets me use my own classes provided they implement ISerializable and have the de-serializer constructor. That is fine by me. I spoke to a friend of mine about this, and he advocates going for a Data Transport Object-only route, where I'd have to maintain a separate DataContract object-graph for the transport of data and re-implement my server objects on the client. Another friend of mine said that because my service only has two operations (""GetServerConfiguration"" and ""PutServerConfiguration"") it might be worthwhile just skipping WCF entirely and implementing my own server that uses Sockets. So my questions are: Has anyone faced a similar problem before and if so, are there better approaches? Is it wise to send an entire object graph to the client for processing? Should I instead break it down so that the client requests a part of the object graph as it needs it and sends only bits that have changed (thus reducing concurrency-related risks?)? If sending the object-graph down is the right way, is WCF the right tool? And if WCF is right, what's the best way to get WCF to serialise my object graph? ","Object graphs can be used with DataContract serialization. Note: Make sure you're preserving object references, so that you don't end up with multiple copies of the same object in the graph when they should all be the same reference, the default behavior does not preserve identity like this. This can be done by specifying the preserveObjectReferences parameter when constructing a DataContractSerializer or by specifying true for the IsReference property on DataContractAttribute (this last attribute requires .NET 3.5SP1). However, when sending object graphs over WCF, you have the risk of running afoul of WCF quotas (and there are many) if you don't take care to ensure the graph is kept to a reasonable size. For the net.tcp transport, for example, important ones to set are maxReceivedMessageSize, maxStringContentLength, and maxArrayLength. Not to mention a hidden quota of 65335 distinct objects allowed in a graph (maxObjectsInGraph), that can only be overridden with difficulty. You can also use classes that only expose read accessors with the DataContractSerializer, and have no parameterless constructors: using System; using System.IO; using System.Runtime.Serialization; class DataContractTest { static void Main(string[] args) { var serializer = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(NoParameterLessConstructor)); var obj1 = new NoParameterLessConstructor(""Name"", 1); var ms = new MemoryStream(); serializer.WriteObject(ms, obj1); ms.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin); var obj2 = (NoParameterLessConstructor)serializer.ReadObject(ms); Console.WriteLine(""obj2.Name: {0}"", obj2.Name); Console.WriteLine(""obj2.Version: {0}"", obj2.Version); } [DataContract] class NoParameterLessConstructor { public NoParameterLessConstructor(string name, int version) { Name = name; Version = version; } [DataMember] public string Name { get; private set; } [DataMember] public int Version { get; private set; } } } This works because DataContractSerializer can instantiate types without calling the constructor.

Your x-coordinate on the paper could be equated to an arc length on the surface of the cylinder. Arc length (s) is equal to the angle (in radians) times the radius. Your radius is given, so you can compute the angle from the arc length and radius. Angle = Arc Length / Radius. Since you now have the angle and the radius, you can compute the new x-offset, which would be (radius * cos(angle)). So your mapping functions would be: new_x = radius * cos(old_x/radius) new_y = old_y; //y-coordinate doesn't change new_z = radius * sin(old_x/radius); You'll have to enforce boundaries (keep x on the paper, and make sure it's not more than half the circumference (x must be less than or equal to PI*r). Also, watch the signs... especially the z-coordinate, which will depend on whether your coordinate system is right-handed or left-handed, or where you imagine the paper starting on the cylindar (back or front).

However there are a couple reasons why people might want to mirror their project releases (e.g. the installer versus the source code). Here are the two reasons a project might want to do that (and I've definitely seen examples of both of these): Your project is multi-platform - CodePlex is the best place to reach Windows users, so if your software runs on Windows you'll get the most downloads by hosting your project releases there. However if your software also runs on Linux, very few Linux users look for software on CodePlex, so you might want to host the releases on SourceForge as well since it has a high number of Linux users. Your preferred site for development is different then the best site to reach your audience - The project development features vary between the sites, so take a theoretical example of you love using CVS but your project software runs on Windows. SourceForge is the only site that supports CVS, so you might choose to host your project there for development purposes, however you would likely also want to mirror the releases to CodePlex since you'll be able to get the most downloads from Windows users there.

For every external resource inside a web page (ie anything that's not part of the HTML content itself, such as images, scripts, stylesheets, etc), you have to make a separate request to retrieve it. This is how all browsers operate. Many captchas work on a session basis. You initial request to the HTML page is likely creating a session cookie which would be sent back as part of the response headers. This cookie will be expected when the image is requested. If you just do a plain curl request for the image, you won't be sending that cookie, and thus you'll get a different image. You will have to analyze the page and determine exactly what kind of session management is going on, and modify your Curl request appropriately, but as I mentioned, I suspect it'll be cookie based. You'll probably want to look at the CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR curl_setopt() parameter to get things started. You can google for pretty straightforward examples as well. "

If the number of lines you're skipping is large, you can improve performance by reading large blocks and counting newlines in each block, stopping and repositioning the file to the last newline's location.

How should I change the code to obtain the expected result? ","You need to pass an Expression instead of an Action. It's actually not that hard to use expression trees for this once you understand what the tree looks like. The line of code: (MyClass c) =&gt; c.TestMethod(); Can be broken down as as a lambda expression (the entire block), containing one parameter (c, on the left side), and a body (c.TestMethod(), on the right side). Then the ""body"" is a method call on a specific object (which is the parameter, c), an actual method (TestMethod), and a set of arguments (in this case, there aren't any). Visually: LambdaExpression [ (MyClass c) =&gt; c.TestMethod() ] / \ / \ / \ Parameters Body [ MethodCallExpression: c.TestMethod() ] | / \ | / \ 1: MyClass c Object [c] \ /\ / \ / \ Method [TestMethod] Arguments [Empty] What you want is the method name, inside the method call expression, inside the body of the lambda expression.

You can adjust this to throw an exception instead, return a default value, or perform whatever other action you think is appropriate. You don't need to do anything special to use this - it's the same usage as your original method: string methodName = GetInnerMethodName&lt;MyClass&gt;(c =&gt; c.TestMethod()); "

Is that what you meant to do? I suspect not.) Anyway, as Michael said, datetime.fromtimestamp gives you a naïve datetime corresponding to what local time for that POSIX (UTC) timestamp would be for you. So when you call — date = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(adjusted_timestamp) you're getting the local time for the POSIX timestamp representing 2010-04-04T00:00:00, which of course in BST is an hour ahead. This doesn't happen in the return direction because your epoch is in January, when BST is not in force. (However your EPOCH would also be completely off if you weren't in the UK.) You should replace both your uses of datetime.fromtimestamp with datetime.utcfromtimestamp. It's sad that datetime continues the awful time tradition of keeping times in local time. Calling them ‘naïve’ and taking away the DST flag just makes them even worse.

This will run the query and convert the results to a List of the object.

Until the query is actually enumerated (or explicitly materialized by calling a method like ToList()), the query hasn't been performed. You need to make sure that the query is performed before the context is disposed. The quickest way to do that, given the code you show, is calling ToList(). You could, perhaps, also just extend the context scope to cover your usage, but if you are supplying the data to a view (web page), that's not likely to be effective. In other contexts, however, it might be possible -- say to just include the enumeration of the query inside the using block of the context. "

Not a big difference but might help if PHP is more of your comfort zone for web stuff than Perl's CGI OTOH, if the Perl script wrapper is a fairly obvious and simple set of API calls, and you feel comfortable with Perl CGI, a better soltrion is to port that command line Perl script into the Perl CGI script which uses the API internally, bypassing system calls. For high-volume stuff, removing system calls is a Big Win performance wise, plus allows for much better and easier error handling. "

How should each be configured? Some context: I have a simple web site project that contains a single .svc web service, and I want it to use Basic authentication over SSL. (Also, I want it to not use Windows accounts, but maybe that is another question.) ","The first two are really about access to an ASP.NET virtual directory or virtual application in IIS6 - that has basically nothing to do with WCF (WCF is actually not part nor dependent on ASP.NET). The settings control how the HTTP request coming into the IIS6 web server is being handled in terms of authentication. This basically controls whether anonymous callers from the internet can just call in without authenticating, or whether they need to enter username/password, or whether only callers with a valid Windows identity in this domain are allowed in. The only reason this is interesting to your WCF service is the fact that when you host the WCF service in IIS (only one of the many options), then you have a (myservice).svc file that needs to reside inside a virtual directory. Of course, access to that SVC file is controlled by the authentication settings of IIS6/ASP.NET. The security mode inside the &lt;wsHttpBinding&gt; section is the security-related definition of how the WCF service will communicate with its clients. Mode=Transport means, you're securing the actual transport layer - typically using SSL - not each message separately. This setting works great in Intranet scenarios where you have all clients behind a corporate firewall - but it won't work too well in Internet scenarios, since you can't really control the whole chain from the client (anywhere on this planet) over a series of intermediary hops to your server - you just can't. In this case, you'd have to use Mode=Message which basically encrypts and signs each message that goes over the wires - that works over any number of routers and relays along the way from the point of origin to your server.

712,"I've got a handmade ORM in PHP that seems to be bumping up against an object limit and causing php to crash.

Some boxes take more than 40,000 objects. I've tried it on Linux/Apache (fail) but my app runs on IIS/FastCGI. On FastCGI this causes the famous ""The FastCGI process exited unexpectedly"" error. Obviously 20k objects is a bit high, but it crashes with far fewer objects if they have data and nested complexity. Fast CGI isn't the issue - I've tried running it from the command line. I've tried setting the memory to something really high - 6,000MB and to something really low - 24MB. If I set it low enough I'll get the ""allocated memory size xxx bytes exhausted"" error. I'm thinking that it has to do with the number of functions that are called - some kind of nesting prevention. I didn't think that my ORM's nesting was that complicated but perhaps it is. I've got some pretty clear cases where if I load just ONE more object it dies, but loads in under 3 seconds if it works. ","Interestingly, in my environment, it appears that the segfault occurs when it comes time to deconstruct the objects -- code placed after the loop runs fine. It's only when PHP starts to shutdown that the segfault occurs. You could file a bug, but you may find that PHP's maintainers won't go out of their way to support this sort of thing. I've seen at least one bug report about a memory leak in which the official response was essentially ""Wontfix: memory is released after the page is rendered, so this doesn't really matter"" -- effectively implying that uses outside of the simple case of rapidly rendering a webpage and terminating aren't really supported. After 5 years of full-time PHP development, I've arrived at a simple rule: if it crashes PHP, don't do it. PHP has its limitations, and you'll find yourself most successful if you don't push those limits. That means things like avoiding create_function() in PHP &lt;=5.2 (it leaks memory like crazy). You can try to use create_function() to use PHP as if it were a functional language. It's not, and you'll find it fails miserably if you try to use it as such. So if PHP chokes on nesting objects 40000 levels deep... don't nest objects 40000 levels deep. One possible alternative is using arrays instead of objects -- but that still sounds pretty heinous. "

If it's important for you to do a projection (i.e. to use select new { ... }) then you should be able to use the let keyword: var media = from p in postService.GetMedia(postId) group p by p.SynthId into g let firstPost = g.First() select new { PostId = firstPost.PostId, SynthId = firstPost.SynthId }; If you want all null values for SynthId to be in their own group, then I would probably filter the first list and then do a concatenation, i.e.: var media = postService.GetMedia(postId); var myMedia = (from p in media where p.SynthId != null group p by p.SynthId into g let firstPost = g.First() select new { PostId = firstPost.PostId, SynthId = firstPost.SynthId }) .Concat (from p in media where p.SynthId == null select new { PostId = firstPost.PostId, SynthId = firstPost.SynthId }); "

722,"If I have an object that I would like to force to be accessed from within a lock, like so: var obj = new MyObject(); lock (obj) { obj.Date = DateTime.Now; obj.Name = ""My Name""; } Is it possible, from within the AddOne and RemoveOne functions to detect whether the current execution context is within a lock? Something like: Monitor.AreWeCurrentlyEnteredInto(this) Edit: (for clarification of intent) The intent here is to be able to reject any modification made outside of the lock, so that all changes to the object itself will be transactional and thread-safe. Locking on a mutex within the object itself does not ensure a transactional nature to the edits. I know that it is possible to do this: var obj = new MyObject(); obj.MonitorEnterThis(); try { obj.Date = DateTime.Now; obj.Name = ""My Name""; } finally { obj.MonitorExitThis(); } But this would allow any other thread to call the Add/Remove functions without first calling the Enter, thereby circumventing the protection. Edit 2: Here is what I'm currently doing: var obj = new MyObject(); using (var mylock = obj.Lock()) { obj.SetDate(DateTime.Now, mylock); obj.SetName(""New Name"", mylock); } Which is simple enough, but it has two problems: I'm implementing IDisposable on the mylock object, which is a little bit of an abuse of the IDisposable interface. I would like to change the SetDate and SetName functions to Properties, for clarity. ","There's no documented method of checking for this kind of condition at runtime, and if there were, I'd be suspicious of any code that used it, because any code that alters its behaviour based on the call stack would be very difficult to debug. True ACID semantics are not trivial to implement, and I personally wouldn't try; that's what we have databases for, and you can use an in-memory database if you need the code to be fast/portable. If you just want forced-single-threaded semantics, that is a somewhat easier beast to tame, although as a disclaimer I should mention that in the long run you'd be better off simply providing atomic operations as opposed to trying to prevent multi-threaded access. Let's suppose that you have a very good reason for wanting to do this. Here is a proof-of-concept class you could use: public interface ILock : IDisposable { } public class ThreadGuard { private static readonly object SlotMarker = new Object(); [ThreadStatic] private static Dictionary&lt;Guid, object&gt; locks; private Guid lockID; private object sync = new Object(); public void BeginGuardedOperation() { lock (sync) { if (lockID == Guid.Empty) throw new InvalidOperationException(""Guarded operation "" + ""was blocked because no lock has been obtained.""); object currentLock; Locks.TryGetValue(lockID, out currentLock); if (currentLock != SlotMarker) { throw new InvalidOperationException(""Guarded operation "" + ""was blocked because the lock was obtained on a "" + ""different thread from the calling thread.""); } } } public ILock GetLock() { lock (sync) { if (lockID != Guid.Empty) throw new InvalidOperationException(""This instance is "" + ""already locked.""); lockID = Guid.NewGuid(); Locks.Add(lockID, SlotMarker); return new ThreadGuardLock(this); } } private void ReleaseLock() { lock (sync) { if (lockID == Guid.Empty) throw new InvalidOperationException(""This instance cannot "" + ""be unlocked because no lock currently exists.""); object currentLock; Locks.TryGetValue(lockID, out currentLock); if (currentLock == SlotMarker) { Locks.Remove(lockID); lockID = Guid.Empty; } else throw new InvalidOperationException(""Unlock must be invoked "" + ""from same thread that invoked Lock.""); } } public bool IsLocked { get { lock (sync) { return (lockID != Guid.Empty); } } } protected static Dictionary&lt;Guid, object&gt; Locks { get { if (locks == null) locks = new Dictionary&lt;Guid, object&gt;(); return locks; } } #region Lock Implementation class ThreadGuardLock : ILock { private ThreadGuard guard; public ThreadGuardLock(ThreadGuard guard) { this.guard = guard; } public void Dispose() { guard.ReleaseLock(); } } #endregion } There's a lot going on here but I'll break it down for you: Current locks (per thread) are held in a [ThreadStatic] field which provides type-safe, thread-local storage. The field is shared across instances of the ThreadGuard, but each instance uses its own key (Guid). The two main operations are GetLock, which verifies that no lock has already been taken and then adds its own lock, and ReleaseLock, which verifies that the lock exists for the current thread (because remember, locks is ThreadStatic) and removes it if that condition is met, otherwise throws an exception. The last operation, BeginGuardedOperation, is intended to be used by classes that own ThreadGuard instances. It's basically an assertion of sorts, it verifies that the currently-executed thread owns whichever lock is assigned to this ThreadGuard, and throws if the condition isn't met. There's also an ILock interface (which doesn't do anything except derive from IDisposable), and a disposable inner ThreadGuardLock to implement it, which holds a reference to the ThreadGuard that created it and calls its ReleaseLock method when disposed. Note that ReleaseLock is private, so the ThreadGuardLock.Dispose is the only public access to the release function, which is good - we only want a single point of entry for acquisition and release. To use the ThreadGuard, you would include it in another class: public class MyGuardedClass { private int id; private string name; private ThreadGuard guard = new ThreadGuard(); public MyGuardedClass() { } public ILock Lock() { return guard.GetLock(); } public override string ToString() { return string.Format(""[ID: {0}, Name: {1}]"", id, name); } public int ID { get { return id; } set { guard.BeginGuardedOperation(); id = value; } } public string Name { get { return name; } set { guard.BeginGuardedOperation(); name = value; } } } All this does is use the BeginGuardedOperation method as an assertion, as described earlier. Note that I'm not attempting to protect read-write conflicts, only multiple-write conflicts. If you want reader-writer synchronization then you'd need to either require the same lock for reading (probably not so good), use an additional lock in MyGuardedClass (the most straightforward solution) or alter the ThreadGuard to expose and acquire a true ""lock"" using the Monitor class (be careful). And here's a test program to play with: class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { MyGuardedClass c = new MyGuardedClass(); RunTest(c, TestNoLock); RunTest(c, TestWithLock); RunTest(c, TestWithDisposedLock); RunTest(c, TestWithCrossThreading); Console.ReadLine(); } static void RunTest(MyGuardedClass c, Action&lt;MyGuardedClass&gt; testAction) { try { testAction(c); Console.WriteLine(""SUCCESS: Result = {0}"", c); } catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine(""FAIL: {0}"", ex.Message); } } static void TestNoLock(MyGuardedClass c) { c.ID = 1; c.Name = ""Test1""; } static void TestWithLock(MyGuardedClass c) { using (c.Lock()) { c.ID = 2; c.Name = ""Test2""; } } static void TestWithDisposedLock(MyGuardedClass c) { using (c.Lock()) { c.ID = 3; } c.Name = ""Test3""; } static void TestWithCrossThreading(MyGuardedClass c) { using (c.Lock()) { c.ID = 4; c.Name = ""Test4""; ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(s =&gt; RunTest(c, cc =&gt; cc.ID = 5)); Thread.Sleep(2000); } } } As the code (hopefully) implies, only the TestWithLock method completely succeeds. The TestWithCrossThreading method partially succeeds - the worker thread fails, but the main thread has no trouble (which, again, is the desired behaviour here). This isn't intended to be production-ready code, but it should give you the basic idea of what has to be done in order to both (a) prevent cross-thread calls and (b) allow any thread to take ownership of the object as long as nothing else is using it.

724,"Double has range more than a 64-bit integer, but its precision is less dues to its representation (since double is 64-bit as well, it can't fit more actual values).

Now, the question: is there a way in C++ to check if the entire range of a given integer type can fit into a loating point type without loss of precision? Preferably, it would be a compile-time check that can be used in a static assertion, and would not involve enumerating the constants the compiler should know or can compute.

Is there a better way to do this or am I pretty much on track? P.S. I am not planning on using a select element, I was planning on building a custom drop-down menu using CSS since select elements are so highly non-customizable.

","It sounds like you're on the right track. If you're planing on doing a POST when the user clicks the submit button containing (amongst other things) the privacy value, then you'll need to pack it in the POST data somehow, and a hidden field is a way to do it. Alternatively if you were interested in making use of jQuery (which I know you said you weren't but just putting it out there) you can perform asynchronous POST requests passing along with it arbitrary data, such as in this instance the privacy setting, without needing to 'copy' it into a hidden field.

When you invoke the event, this is really iterating over that list and invoking each delegate with the parameters you have passed. The problem with threads is that they could be adding or removing items from this collection by subscribing/unsubscribing. If they do this while you are iterating the collection this will cause problems (I think an exception is thrown) The intent is to copy the list before iterating it, so you are protected against changes to the list.

731,"I'm taking 5 strings (protocol, source IP and port, destination IP and port) and using them to store some values in a hash. The problem is that if the IPs or ports are switched between source and destination, the key is supposed to be the same. If I was doing this in C#/Java/whatever I'd have to create a new class and overwrite the hashcode()/equals() methods, but that seems error prone from the little I've read about it and I was wondering if there would be a better alternative here. ","I am directly copying a paragraph from Programming Ruby 1.9: Hash keys must respond to the message hash by returning a hash code, and the hash code for a given key must not change. The keys used in hashes must also be comparable using eql?. If eql? returns true for two keys, then those keys must also have the same hash code. This means that certain classes (such as Array and Hash) can't conveniently be used as keys, because their hash values can change based on their contents. So you might generate your hash as something like [""#{source_ip} #{source_port}"", ""#{dest_ip} #{dest_port}"", protocol.to_s].sort.join.hash such that the result will be identical when the source and destination are switched. For example: source_ip = ""1.2.3.4"" source_port = 1234 dest_ip = ""5.6.7.8"" dest_port = 5678 protocol = ""http"" def make_hash(s_ip, s_port, d_ip, d_port, proto) [""#{s_ip} #{s_port}"", ""#{d_ip} #{d_port}"", proto.to_s].sort.join.hash end puts make_hash(source_ip, source_port, dest_ip, dest_port, protocol) puts make_hash(dest_ip, dest_port, source_ip, source_port, protocol) This will output the same hash even though the arguments are in a different order between the two calls. Correctly encapsulating this functionality into a class is left as an exercise to the reader. "

To be less stringent than that but requiring at least two numbers anywhere in the string: /^(?=.{6,12}$)(?=(.*?\d){2})(?=(.*?[A-Z]){2})(?=(.*?[a-z]){2})/ Lastly you'll note that I'm using non-greedy expressions (.*?). That will avoid a lot of backtracking and for this kind of validation is what you should generally use. The difference between: (.*\d){2} and (.*?\d){2} Is that the first will grab all the characters with .* and then look for a digit. It won't find one because it will be at the end of the string so it will backtrack one characters and then look for a digit. If it's not a digit it will keep backtracking until it finds one. After it does it will match that whole expression a second time, which will trigger even more backtracking. That's what greedy wildcards means. The second version will pass on zero characters to .*? and look for a digit. If it's not a digit .*? will grab another characters and then look for a digit and so on. Particularly on long search strings this can be orders of magnitude faster. On a short password it almost certainly won't make a difference but it's a good habit to get into of knowing how the regex matcher works and writing the best regex you can. That being said, this is probably an example of being too clever for your own good. If a password is rejected as not satisfying those conditions, how do you determine which one failed in order to give feedback to the user about what to fix? A programmatic solution is, in practice, probably preferable. "
735,"I'm using HTMLPurifier in a current project and I'm not sure about the most efficient way to go about handling multiple configs. For the most part the only major thing changing is the allowed tags. Currently I have a private method, in each class using HTMLPurifier, that gets called when a config is needed and it creates one from the default. I'm not really happy with this as if 2 classes are using the same config, that's duplicating code, and what if a class needs 2 configs? It just feels messy. The one upside to it, is it's lazy in the sense that it's not creating anything until it's needed. The various classes could be used and never have to purify anything. So I don't want to be creating a bunch of config objects that might not even be used. I just recently found out that you can create a new instance of HTMLPurifier and directly set config options like so: $purifier = new HTMLPurifier(); $purifier-&gt;config-&gt;set('HTML.Allowed', ''); I'm not sure if that's bad form at all or not, and if it isn't I'm not really sure of a good way to put it to use. My latest idea was to create a config handler class that would just return an HTMLPurifier config for use in subsequent purify calls. At some point it could probably be expanded to allow the setting of configs, but just from the start I figured they'd just be hardcoded and run a method parameter through a switch to grab the requested config. Perhaps I could just send the stored purifier instance as an argument and have the method directly set the config on it like shown above? This to me seems the best of the few ways I thought of, though I'm not sure if such a task warrants me creating a class to handle it, and if so, if I'm handling it in the best way. I'm not too familiar with the inner workings of HTMLPurifier so I'm not sure if there are any better mechanisms in place for handling multiple configs. Thanks for any insight anyone can offer. ","I just wrote up a quick, simple config handler class. You can view / use it @ http://gist.github.com/358187/ It takes an array of configs at initialization. $configs = array( 'HTML.Doctype' =&gt; 'HTML 4.01 Strict', 'posts' =&gt; array( 'HTML.Allowed' =&gt; 'p,a[href],img[src]' ), 'comments' =&gt; array( 'HTML.Allowed' =&gt; 'p' ), 'default' =&gt; array( 'HTML.Allowed' =&gt; '' ) ); Directives put directly into the array are global and will be applied to all configs. If the same directive is set inside a named config, the value in the named config will be used. Then you can grab a config like so: $purifierConfig = new purifierConfig($configs); $commentsConfig = $purifierConfig-&gt;getConfig('comments'); or, shorthand: $commentsConfig = $purifierConfig['comments']; If the requested config does not exist or no config is specified in the call, the default config will be returned. I'll probably flesh it out at some point, but for now this works. I was looking for how people handled such things in their projects or if there were any built in mechanisms that made something like this more steamlined, but I suppose my question was a bit too narrow in scope.

736,"What exactly is the Java Real Time Specification? That is, how does it differ from the ""regular"" Java SE or Java EE specifications? "," At its core, real-time computing is about predictability -- the knowledge that the system will always perform within the required time frame. Basically, this is something you won't be able to achieve with the regular VM (and its stop-the-world GC amongst other things), hence the need for another specification: The Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ), or JSR 1, specifies how Java systems should behave in a real-time context and was developed over several years by experts from both the Java and real-time domains. The RTSJ is designed to seamlessly extend any Java family -- whether the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE); Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME); or Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) -- and has the requirement that any implementation pass both the JSR 1 technology compatibility kit (TCK) and the TCK of the platform -- Java SE, Java ME, or Java EE -- on which it is based. The RTSJ introduces several new features to support real-time operations. These features include new thread types, new memory-management models, and other newly introduced frameworks. (...) I warmly recommend the reading of: An Introduction to Real-Time Java Technology: Part 1, The Real-Time Specification for Java (JSR 1) An Introduction to Real-Time Java Technology: Part 2, Garbage Collection and the Sun Java Real-Time System (Java RTS) "

738,"I'm doing some specific signal analysis, and I am in need of a method that would smooth out a given bell-shaped distribution curve. A running average approach isn't producing the results I desire. I want to keep the min/max, and general shape of my fitted curve intact, but resolve the inconsistencies in sampling. In short: if given a set of data that models a simple quadratic curve, what statistical smoothing method would you recommend? If possible, please reference an implementation, library, or framework. Thanks SO! Edit: Some helpful data (A possible signal graph) The dark colored quadratic is my ""fitted"" curve of the light colored connected data points. The sample @ -44 (approx.), is a problem in my graph (i.e. a potential sample inconsistency). I need this curve to ""fit"" the distribution better, and overcome the values that do not trend accordingly. Hope this helps! ","A ""quadratic"" curve is one thing; ""bell-shaped"" usually means a Gaussian normal distribution. Getting a best-estimate Gaussian couldn't be easier: you compute the sample mean and variance and your smooth approximation is y = exp(-squared(x-mean)/variance) If, on the other hand, you want to approximate a smooth curve with a quadradatic, I'd recommend computing a quadratic polynomial with minimum square error. I can nenver remember the formulas for this, but if you've had differential calculus, write the formula for the total square error (pointwise) and differentiate with respect to the coefficients of your quadratic. Set the first derivatives to zero and solve for the best approximation. Or you could look it up. Finally, if you just want a smooth-looking curve to approximate a set of points, cubic splines are your best bet. The curves won't necessarily mean anything, but you'll get a nice smooth approximation. "

We commented out the line: HttpContext.Current.Response.AddHeader(""Content-Length"", File.Length.ToString()); ... and it worked. If anyone can see a bug in that, let us know, otherwise I guess it was some kind of IIS or load balancer configuration problem, that only appears when manually setting the content-length on binary files, and only in Firefox (!?). ","MGOwen I will share my experience for a similar problem that I was have. Some time ago I have a similar problem, the pages work well, except some pages that after compress them with gZipped they have problems and not working correctly, something like yours.

So check if you set the Content-Length in a way on your pages, and then use gZip filter. If yes then remove the Content-Length setting in your program. In general speaking I say that the length have the problem on your page, and the lenght is a variable in Content-Length. -and in your header the Content-Length exist !- update Also one other think that I notice, if your page send as gZip where is that in your head ? if this is the full head of your page.

768,The Decorator Pattern is dynamic extension-at-runtime of classes. It dynamically forms a is-a relationship. I started to wonder if I was over-complicating my API by using the Decorator Pattern after I got this answer about the difference between a mixin and an abstract class. ,"A mixin is apt when you're adding some behavior to your class. e.g. the ability to enumerate in case of a collection type. You can mixin as many sets of behavior into your class as you want. Its a nice way to reuse common code ; you basically get a bunch of methods for free. A decorator on the other hand is more of a sneaky interceptor. It exposes the same public interface as the target object, contains a target object to which it delegates all client calls ; however it decorates the call with some pre and/or post processing. e.g. if I'm writing code against a MyCollection and I want all calls to this type to be logged. I could derive a new decorator MyCollectionWithTimeStampedLogging both deriving from an ICollection base so that they look identical to the client. The decorator would take an instance of ICollection as a ctor param and delegate calls to it. e.g. Add would look like this public void Add( int item) { _logger.log(String.Format( ""{0} Add called with param {1}"", DateTime.Now, item.ToString()); _collection.Add(item); _logger.log(String.Format( ""{0} Add completed with param {1}"", DateTime.Now, item.ToString()); } "
769,"I have a service monitor app that monitors the status of three other servers app - you know those kind of green, red status stuff, start, stop, etc. The problem is that it shows the wrong state in Windows 7 even if the user is the administrator. The start, stop buttons are disabled and the install button enabled, the status color is grey which is also wrong. The start button should be enabled with the service status showing green - the apps are running. If the application is run with the setting ""run as administrator"" then it behaves normally. The application is written in Delphi 7 and works perfectly in other versions of Windows. This line of code: OpenSCManager(PChar(sMachine), Nil, SC_MANAGER_ALL_ACCESS); always return 0 under Win7, causing the problem. Any ideas and if possible, any workaround apart from ""run as administrator"". ","The service manager can be opened without requiring Administrator privileges if limited access is requested. This line of code: ManagerHandle := OpenSCManager(nil, SERVICES_ACTIVE_DATABASE, SC_MANAGER_ENUMERATE_SERVICE); opens the database of active services with the service manager, even when used from a limited user account. The returned handle can then be used to call EnumServicesStatusEx() to get information about the running services. Passing SC_MANAGER_ALL_ACCESS as the dwDesiredAccess parameter implies passing SC_MANAGER_CREATE_SERVICE, and as the documentation states: Only processes with Administrator privileges are able to open a database handle that can be used by the CreateService function. So if you limit your program to actions that can be performed by standard users, then your code should run without changes on Windows 7. Everything else needs to be done either by the installer, or by a special program that runs elevated. This is BTW no new requirement of Windows 7, your statement The application is written in Delphi 7 and works perfectly in other versions of Windows. shows only that you never properly tested the application on limited accounts in earlier versions of the OS. With Windows NT already (nearly 20 years ago) a limited user was not allowed to open the service manager with full access rights, so the code would fail there just the same. "

This factor, and smaller process geometries, the economics of on-chip memory, and system power constraints have encouraged the use of caches to meet growing system demands. thanks. ","It refers to the size of the ""wires"" in a processor (or memory) such as ""35 micron"". The term ""process"" refers to how the chips (processor) is fabricated and not the process-or :-) So, for a given layout, a processor with a smaller process geometry will be smaller.

It probably uses the same hardware acceleration as OpenGL does. These layers may be used for transitions in the visualizer. Your bet is as good as mine, but you're probably right. They may use some set of mathematical equations that takes as input a number of variables (such as the amplitude of the sound) and produce an image. "

For this to work the Question implementations must have a constructor without arguments.

This can be generalized to arbitrary polygons, and will even give reasonable results for non-planar polygons, as long as they aren't too non-planar. One reference is http://softsurfer.com/Archive/algorithm_0101/algorithm_0101.htm If you know that the quad/polygon is planar, you only have to calculate the normal of the triangle formed by the first three vertices.

So you cannot just access it from within the GenerateObject and Evaluating classes. If you want runnersArray to be a globally visible object, then perhaps it should be a public static variable. public class Runners extends Party { public static Runners[] runnersArray = new Runners[5]; } Then you can access it from the other classes like this: public class GenerateObject extends /* certain parent class */ { public GenerateObject (int arrayNum) { Runners.runnersArray[arrayNum] = /* certain Runners attributes */; } } Hope this helps.

791,"For my programming languages class one hw problem asks: Are local variables in FORTRAN static or stack dynamic? Are local variables that are INITIALIZED to a default value static or stack dynamic? Show me some code with an explanation to back up your answer. Hint: The easiest way to check this is to have your program test the history sensitivity of a subprogram. Look at what happens when you initialize the local variable to a value and when you don’t. You may need to call more than one subprogram to lock in your answer with confidence. I wrote a few subroutines: - create a variable - print the variable - initialize the variable to a value - print the variable again Each successive call to the subroutine prints out the same random value for the variable when it is uninitialized and then it prints out the initialized value. What is this random value when the variable is uninitialized? Does this mean Fortran uses the same memory location for each call to the subroutine or it dynamically creates space and initializes the variable randomly? My second subroutine also creates a variable, but then calls the first subroutine. The result is the same except the random number printed of the uninitialized variable is different. I am very confused. Please help! Thank you so much. ","In Fortran 77 &amp; 90/95/2003, if you want the value of a variable local to a subroutine preserved across subroutine calls, you should declare it the ""save"" attribute, e.g., (using Fortran 90 style): integer, save :: counter OR integer :: counter save :: counter . Or, if you want the ""save"" behavior to apply to all variables just include in the subroutine a simple save statement without any variables. In Fortran 90, a variable initialization in a declaration, integer :: counter = 0 automatically acquires the save attribute. I don't think that this was the case in Fortran 77. This is one area in which experiments could be misleading -- they will tell you what a particular compiler does, but perhaps not what the Fortran 77 language standard is, nor what other compilers did. Many old Fortran 77 compilers didn't place local variables on the stack and implicitly all variables had the save attribute, without the programming having used that declaration. This, for example, was the case with the popular DEC Fortran compilers. It is common for legacy Fortran 77 programs that were used only with a particular compiler of this type to malfunction with a modern compiler because programmers forgot to use the save attribute on variables that needed it. Originally this didn't cause a problem because all variables effectively had the save attribute. Most modern compilers place local variables without save on the stack, and these programs frequently malfunction because some variables that need ""save"" ""forget"" their values across subroutine calls. This can be fixed by identifying the problem variables and adding save (work), adding a save statement to every subroutine (less work), or many compilers have an option (e.g., -fno-automatic in gfortran) to restore the old behavior (easy). It seems a peculiar question -- you won't find out about ""Fortran 77"" but about a particular compiler. And why use Fortran 77 instead of Fortran 95/2003? Does the prof. think Fortran stopped in 1977? "

","You must do a signed compare unless you ensure that all the original values were positive. You must use an integer type that is the same size as the original floating point type. Each chip may have a different internal format, so comparing values from different chips as integers is most likely to give misleading results. Most float formats look something like this: sxxxmmmm s is a sign bit xxx is an exponent mmmm is the mantissa The value represented will then be something like: 1mmm &lt;&lt; (xxx-k) 1mmm because there is an implied leading 1 bit unless the value is zero. If xxx &lt; k then it will be a right shift. k is near but not equal to half the largest value that could be expressed by xxx. It is adjusted for the size of the mantissa. All to say that, disregarding NaN, comparing floating point values as signed integers of the same size will yield meaningful results. They are designed that way so that floating point comparisons are no more costly than integer comparisons. There are compiler optimizations to turn off NaN checks so that the comparisons are straight integer comparisons if the floating point format of the chip supports it. As an integer, NaN is greater than infinity is greater than finite values. If you try an unsigned compare, all the negative values will be larger than the positive values, just like signed integers cast to unsigned. "

796,"I'd like to hear if anyone sees any problems with how I implemented the security in this Oracle based MVC.NET app, either security issues, concurrency issues or scalability issues. First, I implemented a CustomOracleMembershipProvider to handle the database interface to the membership store. I implemented a custom Principal named User which implements IPrincipal, and it has a hashtable of Roles. I also created a separate class named AuthCache which has a simple cache for User objects. Its purpose is simple to avoid return trips to the database, while decoupling the caching from either the web layer or the data layer. (So I can share the cache between MVC.NET, WCF, etc.) The MVC.NET stock MembershipService uses the CustomOracleMembershipProvider (configured in web.config), and both MembershipService and FormsService share access to the singleton AuthCache. My AccountController.LogOn() method: 1) Validates the user via the MembershipService.Validate() method, also loads the roles into the User.Roles container and then caches the User in AuthCache. 2) Signs the user into the Web context via FormsService.SignIn() which accesses the AuthCache (not the database) to get the User, sets HttpContext.Current.User to the cached User Principal. In global.asax.cs, Application_AuthenticateRequest() is implemented. It decrypts the FormsAuthenticationTicket, accesses the AuthCache by the ticket.Name (Username) and sets the Principal by setting Context.User = user from the AuthCache. So in short, all these classes share the AuthCache, and I have, for thread synchronization, a lock() in the cache store method. No lock in the read method. The custom membership provider doesn't know about the cache, the MembershipService doesn't know about any HttpContext (so could be used outside of a web app), and the FormsService doesn't use any custom methods besides accessing the AuthCache to set the Context.User for the initial login, so it isn't dependent on a specific membership provider. The main thing I see now is that the AuthCache will be sharing a User object if a user logs in from multiple sessions. So I may have to change the key from just UserId to something else (maybe using something in the FormsAuthenticationTicket for the key?). ","Why use a Hashtable for the roles? A plain list would likely be faster to search unless you expect people to have more than a handful of roles. If you can predict all roles in advance then using a bitmask/flags enumeration would be even better. You should try to avoid writing your own locking mechanism, as it's fairly easy to get wrong. Use the new System.Collections.Concurrent classes, or if you must roll your own then be sure to use Interlocked (as all the other locking mechanisms are quite expensive). Caching should use WeakReference encapsulation to allow entries to be GCed and support retrieving user information from the database if an entry is missing. Maybe have a look at Velocity if you need a distributed cache. Sharing user objects might not be a problem, but is probably not a recommended strategy. Many database access frameworks will track objects retrieved in a session or unit of work, and sharing objects across sessions would then be problematic. If you do go for sharing user objects then be sure to make them immutable. Last, I personally despise the whole Membership Provider API, because it uses GUIDs for identification and the default SQL Server database design for user profiles is just horrible (aka performance killer). This does not seem to be a concern for you as you've rolled your own (db and implementation) but you might want to evaluate whether there are any real benefits involved from implementing the API, or whether it's mostly shackles tying you to specific ways of doing things.

797,"I am developing a small application with images and trash box icon on right hand bottom. I have multiple images floating in the main window, and using mouse I can move image from one corner to other corner of window, left, right, top and bottom. I can't figure out how do I catch an event when a image touches and panel (with trash box image), in the right hand corner. Does anybody knows which event or handler to listen? This is not a drag and drop case since my images are floating so no point using drag and drop. Thank you ","Per this thread (MSDN), you could listen to an event fired when your image moves, and get Rects representing the trash box and the image, then use the IntersectsWith() method to detect if they are ""touching"". Other than that, there are the UIElement events DragEnter, DragOver, and Drop (as well as their Preview___ counterparts) which might fit the bill. However, those are part of drag-and-drop. I'm not convinced that drag-and-drop is not appropriate in this situation. It sounds like drag and drop to me. "

804,"I want to implement a RPC module. Different requests are encoded as JSON objects. They will be decoded and then be handled by a request handler. At last a corresponding response will be returned. The demo code looks as follows: type IRequestHandler = interface function Handle(const Request: TAaaRequest): TResponse; function Handle(const Request: TBbbRequest): TResponse; end; TDecoder = class class function Decode(const Json: TJsonObject; const RequestHandler: IRequestHandler): TResponse; end; class function TDecoder.Decode(const Json: TJsonObject; const RequestHandler: IRequestHandler): TResponse; var Method: string; Request: TObject; begin Method := Json['method'].AsString; if (Method = TAaaRequest.ClassName) then begin Request := TAaaRequest.FromJSON(Json); // Casted as TObject if Request &lt;&gt; nil then begin Result := RequestHandler.Handle(TAaaRequest(Request)); Request.Free; end; end else if (Method = TBbbRequest.ClassName) then begin Request := TBbbRequest.FromJSON(Json); // Casted as TObject if Request &lt;&gt; nil then begin Result := RequestHandler.Handle(TBbbRequest(Request)); Request.Free; end; end else Result := CreateErrorResponse('Unknown method: ' + Json.ToString); end; According to the code, the handling of different request types are very similar. If I have 100 different request types, I have to copy and paste the above code block 100 times. This is not clever. I am looking for a better way to do the same logic. My imagination is as follows: TDecoder = class private FRequestTypes: TDictionary&lt;string, TClassInfo&gt;; // Does this work? public constructor Create; destructor Destroy; override; function Decode(const Json: TJsonObject; const RequestHandler: IRequestHandler): TResponse; end; constructor TDecoder.Create; begin FRequestTypes := TDictionary&lt;string, TClassInfo&gt;.Create; FRequestTypes.Add(TAaaRequest.ClassName, TAaaRequest); // Does this work? FRequestTypes.Add(TBbbRequest.ClassName, TBbbRequest); end; destructor TDecoder.Destroy; begin FRequestTypes.Free; inherited; end; function TDecoder.Decode(const Json: TJsonObject; const RequestHandler: IRequestHandler): TResponse; var Method: string; Info: TClassInfo; Request: TObject; begin Method := Json['method'].AsString; if FRequestTypes.ContainsKey(Method) then begin // An universal way Info := FRequestTypes[Method]; Request := Info.FromJSON(Json); // Casted as TObject if Request &lt;&gt; nil then begin Result := RequestHandler.Handle(Info(Request)); // Casted to corresponding class type (e.g. TAaaRequest or TBbbRequest) Request.Free; end; end else Result := CreateErrorResponse('Unknown method: ' + Json.ToString); end; I do not know, if I can write an universal way to handle a great number of different request types. Development environment Delphi 2010. Any hint is appreciated. ","Your second attempt is very close. You're only missing a couple of details. Where you've used the made-up type TClassInfo, you need to define a metaclass to represent your request classes. I assume TAaaRequest and TBbbRequest (and the 100 other request classes) all descend from some base TRequest class. Define TRequestClass like this: type TRequestClass = class of TRequest; The FromJSON method does something different for each class, right? If that's the case, then it should be virtual. (If the method does the same thing in each class, then it doesn't have to be virtual, despite what others may tell you.) You don't have to type-cast the result of the constructor; simply declare Info as a TRequest instead of a TObject. The biggest change you'll need to make is to your IRequestHandler interface. Since every one of your objects is a TRequest, it will be clumsy to dispatch to the right interface method without having a giant if-else ladder to check each possible class. Instead, use virtual dispatch again. Give each TRequest object a virtual Handle method, so the class declaration will look like this: type TRequest = class public constructor FromJSON(const json: string); function Handle: TResponse; virtual; abstract; end; Implement Handle for each descendant, and you're done. Ultimately, the IRequestHandler interface can go away. You've already written the handling ability into each of the request classes. You don't need one class to represent the request and another class to handle it. If you want to have a separate handling class, then you could either go with what you have already, where you'll have a big conditional to decide which IRequestHandler method you'll call, or you have lots of request-handler objects all implement the same interface, and you decide which one to create the same way you decide which request class to create. Then you give the request object to the request-handler object and let them work together. For example, define your handler interface: type IRequestHandler = interface function Handle(request: TRequest): TResponse; end; Register handlers like you register requests: // Use the same names as the requests, but a different dictionary FRequestHandlers.Add(TAaaRequest.ClassName, TAaaHandler); FRequestHandlers.Add(TBbbRequest.ClassName, TBbbHandler); Instantiate handlers like you do requests: HandlerType := FRequestHandlers[Method]; HandlerObject := HandlerType.Create; if not Supports(HandlerObject, IRequestHandler, Handler) then exit; Then pass the request to the handler: Result := Handler.Handle(Request); "

What I really care about is knowing what benefit becoming open-source has been to Java. ","If you are a mainstream user, there is probably no immediate benefit for you. However, the open-source base of Java makes it easier for people to adapt it to more niche requirements that the closed-source vendor sees no need to support. Smaller vendors (or open source projects) can come up with solutions to these special needs. For example, Java runs on a great variety of platforms and operating systems, most of them supported by companies other than Sun (granted, that was the case even before it was open source). have any of you pros noticed any major difference since the change was made I like the fact that Linux distributions now include the ""official"" Sun JVM and JDK, rather than making you install it separately or use the ""mostly-compatible"" alternative implementation that was provided.

829,"I am attempting to locate the nth element of a List in Prolog.

Basically, I am trying to check to see if a given cell is ""OK"" to move into. Am I missing something? ","Louis, I'm not entirely clear on what you're aiming to do with this code, but a couple of comments that might hopefully help. Things that start with a capital letter in Prolog are variables to be matched against in rules. _ is a special symbol that can be used in place of a variable name to indicate that any value can match. next_safe(_) is therefore only capable of providing you with a true/false answer if you give it a specific value. One of the major benefits of Prolog is the ability to unify against a variable through backtracking (as ony said). This would mean that when written correctly you could just ask Prolog next_safe(X). and it would return all the possible values (safe moves) that unify with X. To go back to the first point about capital letters. This means that OK is actually a variable waiting to be matched. It is effectively an empty box that you are trying to match against another empty box. I think what you're intending is to use the value ok which is different. You do not assign to variables in the same way that you do in other programming styles. Something like the following might be closer to what you are looking for, though I'm still not sure it's right as it looks like you're trying to assign things but I'm not certain how your nth1 works. Cells = [ok, _, _, _, _, _] . ... next_safe(NewLoc) :- facing(CurrentDirection), delta(CurrentDirection, Delta), in_cell(OldLoc), NewLoc is OldLoc + Delta, nth1(NewLoc, Cells, ok). "

For example, the root element of a DataTemplate instantiated in a ListBox has a null Parent. Try using VisualTreeHelper.GetParent instead. The visual tree is the lower-level representation of how WPF elements are organised, and gives you access to all the extra ""bits"" that things like templating throw in there. For example, calling VisualTreeHelper.GetParent on the root element of a DataTemplate instantiated in a ListBox returns a ContentPresenter. Note that just because you can get hold of the parent visual does not necessarily mean you'll be able to remove it. Some elements, such as Panels, provide methods for this. But if the element you locate is part of, say, a CheckBox, I don't think you'll be able to remove it. If you can provide a bit more context for what you're trying to achieve by moving controls around the visual tree, people may be able to offer more specific advice or alternative approaches. "
831,"a very simple method, but don't know what's to test!

Another issue is that the expectation set up for the mock doesn't match the method called. Again, it's another overload.

Here's one possible alternative: [TestMethod] public void Test() { var id = 1; var expectedResult = new DataSet(); var dataAccess = MockRepository.GenerateStub&lt;IDataAccess&gt;(); dataAccess.Stub(x =&gt; x.SelectAnalysisLinksOverviewByAnalysisId(1)) .Return(expectedResult); var analysisBusinessLogic = new AnalysisLinksBusinessLogic(dataAccess); var result = analysisBusinessLogic.GetLinksByAnalysisId(id); Assert.AreEqual(expectedResult, result); } "
832,I just want to import my facebook status and photos to my personal django website but all the examples and documentation i can find are for developing facebook applications. A simple rss feed would be enough but it doesnt seem to exist in facebook. Do i really have to create a full facebook app to do this? ,"A simple facebook application isn't that hard ... excluding trying to decipher the soup on developers.facebook.com. The ""problem"" is that you need to get an application key, application secret, and sometimes a session key in order to access the web services. Unless someone is sharing a service to do just that (I haven't looked, and you'd need to trust them) then the only way to fulfill the requirements are to create an application. However, the application key/application secret don't actually require that you write anything. They will show up in the Facebook Developer Application (the application that allows you to edit your applications...) Now, all you need is a session key (however, a session key is not always required, see the Understanding Sessions link below) -- and hopefully a permanent one. To do this, ask for the extended offline_access permission**. If you grant that to an application then it can get a session for you whenever it feels like it (or rather, the session does not follow the one-hour expiration policies for that application). Extended permissions. Understanding Sessions. Oh, but ignore that 'auth.renewOfflineSession(UID)' example -- the method doesn't exist. I told you the ""developer"" documentation was soup :-) You can use the URL in format: http://www.facebook.com/tos.php?api_key=YOURAPIKEY&amp;req_perms=offline_access to request the permission of yourself. Now see the links below :-) Extra information in: **I'm not entirely sure if new changes to the FB policy affect forever-sessions, but this link seems more than relevant to the task at hand: http://blog.jylin.com/2009/10/01/loading-wall-posts-using-facebookstream_get/ Getting offline_access to work with Facebook Facebook offline access step-by-step (You need never post/share your facebook application -- you can keep it in sandbox mode forever.)

835,"I am looking into alternate ways to do a Matrix Multiplication. Instead of storing my matrix as a two-dimensional array, I am using a vector such as vector&lt;pair&lt;pair&lt;int,int &gt;,int &gt; &gt; to store my matrix. The pair within my pair (pair) stores my indices (i,j) and the other int stores the value for the given (i,j) pair. I thought I might have some luck implementing my sparse array this way. The problem is when I try to multiply this matrix with itself. If this was a 2-d array implementation, I would have multiplied the matrix as follows: for(i=0; i&lt;row1; i++) { for(j=0; j&lt;col1; j++) { C[i][j] = 0; for(k=0; k&lt;col2; k++) C[i][j] += A[i][j] * A[j][k]; } } Can somebody point out a way to achieve the same result using my vector of 'pair of pairs'? Thanks ","So far you can store one value at one location. If you want to store several nonzero entries in the matrix, you will need more pairs of pairs in a larger structure. map&lt;pair&lt;int, int&gt;, int&gt; would be the next logical step. Now you can iterate over rows because the first coordinate is more significant in the map's sorting order. To iterate over columns, reverse that precedence: typedef pair&lt;int, int&gt; mx_coord; struct reverse_compare { bool operator() (mx_coord const &amp;l, mx_coord const &amp;r) const { return l.second &lt; r.second? true : r.second &lt; l.second? false : l.first &lt; r.first; } }; typedef map&lt; mx_coord, int &gt; matrix; typedef map&lt; mx_coord, int, reverse_compare &gt; matrix_transpose; To multiply A by B, transpose B and iterate over A and B, multiplying any elements whose less-significant coordinates match, as the ordering naturally lets you go line-by-line and column-by-column. To transpose B: matrix_transpose b_t( b.begin(), b.end() ); // complexity: n log n "

840,"Does anyone have code to iterate through the nodes of a subtree in TinyXML? IE: Given a parent, iterate through all its children and all of its children's children? ","Begemoth's answer sounds pretty good to me. Here is a simplified version of TiXmlElement's Accept() method, that doesn't use a visitor and instead takes a TiXmlNode* as the parameter: void TiXmlIterator::iterate(const TiXmlNode* el) { cout &lt;&lt; ""Iterating Node "" &lt;&lt; el-&gt;Value() &lt;&lt; endl; // More useful code here... for (const TiXmlNode* node=el-&gt;FirstChild(); node; node=node-&gt;NextSibling()) { iterate(node); } // And/Or here. } The Accept() method takes a TiXmlVisitor as a parameter and does all the iterating for you, though. And you don't have to call it on the whole document, just the root node of the subtree you want to traverse. This way, you can define specific behavior for the subclasses of TiXmlNode, by overriding the right methods. Look at the implementation of TiXmlPrinter in TinyXml's source code for a good example of how it's done. In case you don't want to do that, here is another example: bool MyTiXmlVisitor::Visit(const TiXmlText&amp; text) { cout &lt;&lt; ""Visiting Text: "" &lt;&lt; text.Value() &lt;&lt; endl; return true; // This will ensure it keeps iterating } This will act on all text elements in the subtree of the node you call Accept() on. To act on all the elements, override the remaining virtual methods of TiXmlVisitor. Then, in the code where you want to iterate over the subtree, do the following: subtree_root_node-&gt;Accept( my_tixmlvisitor_object ); "

Anyone have an explanation? ","MyArray is only a pointer, which on your system, has a size of four bytes. When you dynamically create an array, you need to keep track of the size yourself.

842,I want to run my ruby script x times a day (the number might change) on my linux box. What would be the best way to do so if I do not want it to happen at the same time? I want the time (hour and minute) to be random I was thinking of using at command. The script would be called by at in x hours/minutes or so and then the script would set up another call by at. Not sure if there is any better way or only ruby way. ,"I'd consider using the at program to run the programs (instead of using cron directly, because cron really only works on a fixed schedule). I'd also create a program (I'd use Perl; you'll use Ruby) to schedule a random delay until the next time the job is executed. You'll need to consider whether it is crucial that the job is executed 'x' times in 24 hours, and how the randomness should work. What is the range of variation in times. For example, you might have a cron job run at midnight plus 7 minutes, say, which then schedules 'x' at jobs spaced evenly through the day, with a random deviation in the schedule of ±30 minutes. Or you might prefer an alternative that schedules a the jobs with an average gap of 24/x hours and a random deviation of some amount. The difference is that the first mechanism guarantees that you get x events in the day (unless you make things too extreme); the second might sometimes only get x-1 events, or x+1 events, in 24 hours.

Instead, give these numbers names using something like this: enum { MyDistanceBetweenPoints = 33, MyGraphOffsetX = 37, MyGraphOffsetY = 18, }; This way, if you want to change the horizontal offset of the graph, you don't need to hunt down every last relevant numeric literal; you need only change the definition of MyGraphOffsetX. You can also use the current transformation matrix to offset the graph, thereby eliminating the additions from every CGContextMoveToPoint call and eliminating the risk that you'll forget an addition.

855,"From Wikipedia: The complexity of the algorithm is O(n(logn)(loglogn)) bit operations. How do you arrive at that? That the complexity includes the loglogn term tells me that there is a sqrt(n) somewhere. Suppose I am running the sieve on the first 100 numbers (n = 100), assuming that marking the numbers as composite takes constant time (array implementation), the number of times we use mark_composite() would be something like n/2 + n/3 + n/5 + n/7 + ... + n/97 = O(n^2) And to find the next prime number (for example to jump to 7 after crossing out all the numbers that are multiples of 5), the number of operations would be O(n). So, the complexity would be O(n^3). Do you agree? "," Your n/2 + n/3 + n/5 + … n/97 is not O(n), because the number of terms is not constant. [Edit after your edit: O(n2) is too loose an upper bound.] A loose upper-bound is n(1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5+1/6+…1/n) (sum of reciprocals of all numbers up to n), which is O(n log n): see Harmonic number. A more proper upper-bound is n(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + …), that is sum of reciprocals of primes up to n, which is O(n log log n). (See here or here.) The ""find the next prime number"" bit is only O(n) overall, amortized — you will move ahead to find the next number only n times in total, not per step. So this whole part of the algorithm takes only O(n). So using these two you get an upper bound of O(n log log n) + O(n) = O(n log log n) arithmetic operations. If you count bit operations, since you're dealing with numbers up to n, they have about log n bits, which is where the factor of log n comes in, giving O(n log n log log n) bit operations. "

","I don't think that a predicate will do what you are asking here. Instead, what you can do is fetch a single record with the sort descriptor set to sort the dates in descending order. You need to modify your fetch request to include the following: NSSortDescriptor *dateSort = [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@""date"" ascending:NO]; [fetchRequest setSortDescriptors:[NSArray arrayWithObject:dateSort]]; [fetchRequest setFetchLimit:1]; This should get you the Staff object with the most recent date attribute.

866,"From what I understand: when you pass by value, the function makes a local copy of the passed argument and uses that; when the function ends, it goes out of scope. When you pass by const reference, the function uses a reference to the passed argument that can't be modified. I don't understand, however, why one would choose one over the other, except in a situation where an argument needs to be modified and returned. If you had a void function where nothing is getting returned, why choose one over the other? EDIT: So basically passing by const reference avoids copying the object. So in what situations is copying the object good? I mean, why not just use const references all the time if it optimizes performance all the time? ","There are two main considerations. One is the expense of copying the passed object and the second is the assumptions that the compiler can make when the object is a a local object. E.g. In the first form, in the body of f it cannot be assumed that a and b don't reference the same object; so the value of a must be re-read after any write to b, just in case. In the second form, a cannot be changed via a write to b, as it is local to the function, so these re-reads are unnecessary. void f(const Obj&amp; a, Obj&amp; b) { // a and b could reference the same object } void f(Obj a, Obj&amp; b) { // a is local, b cannot be a reference to a } E.g.: In the first example, the compiler may be able to assume that the value of a local object doesn't change when an unrelated call is made. Without information about h, the compiler may not know whether an object that that function has a reference to (via a reference parameter) isn't changed by h. For example, that object might be part of a global state which is modified by h. void g(const Obj&amp; a) { // ... h(); // the value of a might change // ... } void g(Obj a) { // ... h(); // the value of a is unlikely to change // ... } Unfortunately, this example isn't cast iron. It is possible to write a class that, say, adds a pointer to itself to a global state object in its constructor, so that even a local object of class type might be altered by a global function call. Despite this, there are still potentially more opportunities for valid optimizations for local objects as they can't be aliased directly by references passed in, or other pre-existing objects. Passing a parameter by const reference should be chosen where the semantics of references are actually required, or as a performance improvement only if the cost of potential aliasing would be outweighed by the expense of copying the parameter. "
867,"Are very large TextProperties a burden? Should they be compressed? Say I have a information stored in 2 attributes of type TextProperty in my datastore entities. The strings are always the same length of 65,000 characters and have lots of repeating integers, a sample appearing as follows: entity.pixel_idx = 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5....etc. entity.pixel_color = 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...etc. So these above could also be represented using much less storage memory by compressing say using only each integer and the length of its series ( '0,8' for '0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0') but then its takes time and CPU to compress and decompress? Any general ideas? Are there some tricks for testing different attempts to the problem? ","If all of your integers are single-digit numbers (as in your example), then you can reduce your storage space in half by simply omitting the commas. The Short Answer If you expect to have a lot of repetition, then compressing your data makes sense - your data is not so small (65K) and is highly repetitive => it will compress well. This will save you storage space and will reduce how long it takes to transfer the data back from the datastore when you query for it. The Long Answer I did a little testing starting with the short example string you provided and that same string repeated to 65000 characters (perhaps more repetitive than your actual data). This string compressed from 65K to a few hundred bytes; you may want to do some additional testing based on how well your data actually compresses. Anyway, the test shows a significant savings when using compressed data versus uncompressed data (for just the above test where compression works really well!). In particular, for compressed data: API time takes 10x less for a single entity (41ms versus 387ms on average) Storage used is significantly less (so it doesn't look like GAE is doing any compression on your data). Unexpectedly, CPU time is about 50% less (130ms versus 180ms when fetching 100 entities). I expected CPU time to be a little worse since the compressed data has to be uncompressed. There must be some other CPU work (like decoding the protocol buffer) which is even more CPU work for the much larger uncompressed data. These differences mean wall clock time is also significantly faster for the compressed version (&lt;100ms versus 426ms when fetching 100 entities). To make it easier to take advantage of compression, I wrote a custom CompressedDataProperty which handles all of the compressing/decompressing business so you don't have to worry about it (I used it in the above tests too). You can get the source from the above link, but I've also included it here since I wrote it for this answer: from google.appengine.ext import db import zlib class CompressedDataProperty(db.Property): """"""A property for storing compressed data or text.

870,"I have built a pretty simple REST service in Sinatra, on Rack. It's backed by 3 Tokyo Cabinet/Table datastores, which have connections that need to be opened and closed.

I also have some Rack middleware like Warden that rely on these model classes. What's the best way to manage opening and closing the connections? Rack doesn't provide startup/shutdown hooks as I'm aware. I thought about inserting a piece of middleware that provides reference to the TC/TT object in env, but then I'd have to pipe that through Sinatra to the models, which doesn't seem efficient either; and that would only get be a per-request connection to TC. I'd imagine that per-server-instance-lifecycle would be a more appropriate lifespan. Thanks! ","If you have other Rack middleware that depend on these connections (by way of a dependence on your model classes), then I wouldn't put the connection logic in Sinatra -- what happens if you rip out Sinatra and put in another endpoint?

You might have to clean up manually."" end end end end If you later decide you want connection-per-thread or connection-per-request, you can change this middleware to put the connection in the env Hash, but you'll need to change your models as well. Perhaps this middleware could set a connection variable in each model class instead of storing it internally? In that case, you might want to do more checking about the state of the connection in the at_exit hook because another thread/request might have closed it. "

878,"I have a 'legacy' DB2 database that has many other applications and users. Trying to experiment with a rails app. Got everything working great with the ibm_db driver. Problem is that I have some tables like schema1.products, schema1.sales and other tables like schema2.employees and schema2.payroll. In the ibm_db adapter connection, I specify a schema, like schema1 or schema2, and I can work within that one schema, but I need to be able to easily (and transparently) reference both schemas basically interchangeably. I don't want to break the other apps, and the SQL I would normally write against DB2 doesn't have any of these restrictions (schemas can be mixed in SQL against DB2 without any trouble at all). I would like to just specify table names as ""schema1.products"" for example and be done with it, but that doesn't seem to jive with the ""rails way"" of going about it. Suggestions? ","Schemas in DB2 are a very handy way to provide separate namespace to different applications. For example, you can separate all database objects for an application called ""recruiting"" from say application called ""payroll"". You can have objects (tables, views, procedures etc.) with the same name reside in multiple schemas and not colide with one another. Having your application set a schema is a handy way for it to say ""hey, I am a payroll and I only want to work with my objects"". So, what happens when you want to work with objects owned by another application? Well, in traditional procedural programming languages your application code would explicitly specify the schema when referencing an object in another schema or you would just do a SET CURRENT SCHEMA to switch to another schema. The problem with ORMs like ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails is that you are not supposed to use SQL i.e. you don't have a good ""Rails way"" to specify schema when referencing an object. You can use find_by_sql and qualify your objects in the SQL statement but this is not what RoR people will consider to be good Rails. You can fix things on the DB2 side. You can define a view per table in the ""foreign"" schema but you will have to take care to name the view so that it does not colide with what you already have in your primary schema. And, when you do that, you will undoubtedly create names that are not true Rails names. Rails people are very proud of the ""Rails way"". It makes it very easy to create new applications. Rails is really awesome in this space. However, when it comes to integration with what is already out there Rails ... how do we say it ... sucks. I suggest you will have to accept to do things that are not the best examples of the Rails Way if you want to work with existing database structures. "
879,"Environment: Jboss, Mysql, JPA, Hibernate Our web application will be catering to a large amount of users (~ 1,000,000) and there are a lots of child table where user specific data are stored (e.g. personal, health, forum contributions ...). What would be the best practice to archive user &amp; user specific information. [a] Would it be wise to move the archived user &amp; user specific information to their respective tables within the same database (e.g. user_archive, user_forum_comments_archive ...) OR [b] Would you just mark the database entries with a flag in the original table(s) and just query only non archived entries. We have a unique constraint on User.loginid, how do you handle this requirement if the users are archived via 1-[a] (i.e if a user with loginid 'samuel' gets moved into the archive table and if a new user gets added with the same name in the original table, how would you prevent this. What would be the best strategy to address the unique key constraints. We have a requirement to selectively archive records and bring it back if necessary, will you rely on database tools are would you handle this via your persistence APIs exposed by the JPA entity model. ","Personally, I'd go for solution ""[a]"". Having things split on two table sets (current and archived) would make things a bit hard to manage in terms of common RDBMS concepts (example: forum comment author would be a foreign key pointing to the user's table... but you can't have a field behave as a foreign key to two different tables). You could go for a compromise (users table uses solution ""a"", all the other tables like profile get archived to a twin table like per solution ""b"") but this would make things unnecessarily complicated for your code (in some cases you have to look at the non-archived, in some to the archived only, in some other cases to the union of both). Solution A would easily solve #2 and #3 requirements, too. Uniqueness of user name is easy to enforce if everything is in the same table, and resurrecting archived users is just a matter of flipping a bit (Archived=Y/N) on the main user table. 10% is not much, I doubt that the difference in terms of performance would really justify the extra complexity (and risk of bugs).

881,"If a disabled drop-down list is dynamically rendered to the page, it is still possible to use Firebug, or another tool, to tamper with the submitted value, and to remove the ""disabled"" HTML attribute. This code: protected override void OnLoad(EventArgs e) { var ddlTest = new DropDownList() {ID=""ddlTest"", Enabled = false}; ddlTest.Items.AddRange(new [] { new ListItem(""Please select"", """"), new ListItem(""test 1"", ""1""), new ListItem(""test 2"", ""2"") }); Controls.Add(ddlTest); } results in this HTML being rendered: &lt;select disabled=""disabled"" id=""Properties_ddlTest"" name=""Properties$ddlTest""&gt; &lt;option value="""" selected=""selected""&gt;Please select&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value=""1""&gt;test 1&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value=""2""&gt;test 2&lt;/option&gt; &lt;/select&gt; The problem occurs when I use Firebug to remove the ""disabled"" attribute, and to change the selected option. On submission of the form, and re-creation of the field, the newly generated control has the correct value by the end of OnLoad, but by OnPreRender, it has assumed the identity of the submitted control and has been given the submitted form value. .NET seems to have no way of detecting the fact that the field was originally created in a disabled state and that the submitted value was faked. This is understandable, as there could be legitimate, client-side functionality that would allow the disabled attribute to be removed. Is there some way, other than a brute force approach, of detecting that this field's value should not have been changed? I see the brute force approach as being something crap, like saving the correct value somewhere while still in OnLoad, and restoring the value in the OnPreRender. As some fields have dependencies on others, that would be unacceptable to me. ",Use ViewState. It is encrypted enough to stop the average hacker.

I want it to print 1 } } How can I change TrueFalseQuestion class so that the static method is always run so that I get 1 instead of 0 when I run my main method? I do not want any change in the main method. I am actually trying to implement the factory patterns where the subclasses register with the factory but i have simplified the code for this question. ","To register the TrueFalseQuestion class with the factory, its static initializer needs to be called. To execute the static initializer of the TrueFalseQuestion class, the class needs to either be referenced or it needs to be loaded by reflection before QuestionFactory.map.size() is called. If you want to leave the main method untouched, you have to reference it or load it by reflection in the QuestionFactory static initializer. I don't think this is a good idea, but I'll just answer your question :) If you don't mind the QuestionFactory knowing about all classes that implement Question to construct them, you can just reference them directly or load them through reflection. Something like: public class QuestionFactory { static final HashMap&lt;String, String &gt; map = new HashMap&lt;String,String&gt;(); static { this.getClassLoader().loadClass(""TrueFalseQuestion""); this.getClassLoader().loadClass(""AnotherTypeOfQuestion""); // etc. } public static void registerType(String questionName, String ques ) { map.put(questionName, ques); } } Make sure map's declaration and construction is before the static block. If you don't want QuestionFactory to have any knowledge of the implementations of Question, you'll have to list them in a configuration file that gets loaded by QuestionFactory. The only other (possibly insane) way I could think to do it, would be to look through the entire classpath for classes that implement Question :) That might work better if all classes that implemented Question were required to belong to the same package -- NOTE: I am not endorsing this solution ;) The reason I don't think doing any of this in the QuestionFactory static initializer is because classes like TrueFalseQuestion have their own static initializer that calls into QuestionFactory, which at that point is an incompletely constructed object, which is just asking for trouble. Having a configuration file that simply lists the classes that you want QuestionFactory to know how to construct, then registering them in its constructor is a fine solution, but it would mean changing your main method.

Therefore, one path you could take is starting with Python. It's a great language for prototyping, much better than C++ for the stage in which you're not even sure which architecture to adopt. As you finish the project, you can see if Python is efficient enough.

I don't seem to be getting any errors and I don't know how to work out what's wrong. I can open the database from the Notes client on the same machine. UPDATE Here's the code. The fields are initialised in the constructor. The null reference occurs on the .IsOpen() message. public class DominoPersonSearcher { private string _serverName; private string _databaseFileName; private string _password; private Domino.NotesDatabase OpenDatabase(out Domino.NotesSession notesSession) { notesSession = new Domino.NotesSessionClass(); notesSession.Initialize(this._password); Domino.NotesDatabase notesDatabase; notesDatabase = notesSession.GetDatabase(this._serverName, this._databaseFileName, false); if (!(notesDatabase.IsOpen)) { notesDatabase.Open(); } return notesDatabase; } This code is C# and runs on a web server; it's not inside a db - it's running outside of Notes, just calling into it. I've used this exact mechanism many times. It uses a .NET wrapper around the Lotus Domino Objects COM C:\notes\domobj.tlb called Interop.Domino.dll. Domino is installed on a different server. ","Returning null from getdatabase means you could not access the database. If you're running this as a java agent then it will run under your privileges. A server can be configured to restrict who can access databases via agents on a server. Try opening another database on the server that you have the same level of access to or a database you have manager access to. Doing this, checks to see if you can open databases via agents on the server. If you can't open this database either, then it sounds like a permission problem with the server. It's not the database itself, because you can access it via the Notes client. One way around it, is that you can can also tell the agent to run under the server's ID. This usually gets around access issues. The agent's security options is the last tab, on the ""agent properties"" dialog box. Note that this option can also be controlled via server settings, and you'll get an error message if you're not allowed to do this either. Let me know how you go.. "

909,"I've been examining one of my c# books and I just saw a sentence about Events in C#: &nbsp;The main purpose of events is to prevent subscribers from interfering with each other. Whatever it means, yeah actually events are working pretty much like delegates. I've been wondering why I should use events instead of delegates. So is there any one who can explain the bold part? Thanks in advance. ","The choice wouldn't really be between a delegate and an event - they're completely different things. You could, however, expose a public property or a public field which had a delegate type. I assume that's what you really mean. Suppose Button.Click were a public field or property instead of an event. One piece of code could then subscribe to an event, and another could then write: // Invalid with events, valid with properties button.Click = null; thus wiping out the original event handler. Likewise other code would also be able to invoke the event handlers: // Invalid with events, valid with properties button.Click(this, EventArgs.Empty); even though the button hadn't been clicked. This is clearly a violation of encapsulation. The only reason to expose Click to other code is to allow them to register interest in button clicks and register disinterest later - and those are exactly the abilities that events provide. Think of events as syntactic sugar around two methods. For example, if we didn't have events then Button would probably have: public void AddClickHandler(EventHandler handler) public void RemoveClickHandler(EventHandler handler) The violation of encapsulation goes away, but you lose some of the convenience - and everyone has to write their own methods like that. Events simplify this pattern, basically. "
910,"I've been developing .NET applications for 4 years. So far, I did not need to create any implicit conversions for the classes I authored. Could you provide real-life situations when you could not do without creating implicit conversions? Thank you ","Implicit conversions should only be defined when the type can be converted to or from (preferably to and from) another type with no loss of data. Another criterion is that implicit conversions should be fairly inexpensive, because the developer using your class probably won't be aware of when the implicit conversions are happening. One example: conversion between coordinate systems. A polar coordinate vector that can convert to cartesian coordinates, for example, might be convenient. However, due to floating point round off it would still be better to leave this as an explicit conversion so that the programmer has to typecast to force the conversion. Implicit conversion may be warranted if you have two data types that store data in the same format but the only distinction between the types is semantic - how they are used or what they mean. Real world example: Conversion between datetime data types that have the same (or compatible) underlying representation but differ only in epoc start date. You'll find these when migrating older codebases to newer frameworks where both define a datetime type but the semantics are slightly different. Implicit conversion here (assuming there is no data loss at all) is probably ok and a good idea. If you have a set of types and you have defined your own rules for how the types can be converted between each other, then some of those conversions may be implicit and some explicit depending on the ""severity"" of the conversion. The primary instance of where I've used implicit conversion when implementing a class in .NET was when I was implementing Win32 Variant semantics for the Delphi runtime library. Win32 and the Delphi language specify a number of conversions on Variant data that can be done implicity. That you have not found a need to create implicit conversions is actually a good thing. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. Implicit conversions exist in .NET primarily to allow different programming languages to represent their own semantics in a way that should be interoperable and understandable by other .NET languages.

Whenever you save a model form, you get an instance of the respective model back. By using commit=False you explicitly say that this instance should not be saved into the database (now). This is mostly used to do something else with the model before you save it into the database. To refer to your question: The current user is related to the newly created map instance. As this has to be done in the view (to access the request that contains the user), the instance is not saved at first, the user is added, then the instance is saved. So if you want to save this instance you have to call the save() method on this instance manually: map = map_form.save(commit=False) # create instance from form data (validated) if some_condition_is_met: map.property = set_a_certain_value map.members.add(request.user) #relate current user to map map.save() # now save the model to the database But I would not name the variable map as Python has a builtin function named map(). If you try to call this function later in your code, it would probably raise a TypeError as you are overriding the functions name with an instance of some object. Read more about model forms. "

In IE 8, it also accepts pressing enter, displays the text value in the address bar, but it doesn't show the button's value as a GET param at all... does that mean it's not submitting it? I can't use hidden inputs because I need to determine which button is clicked without JS.

It'll send ""submit"", not ""submit1"" which is inconsistent with FF. However, submitting the form only sends the value of one button in both browsers, which means I might be able to check which button was clicked by checking if GET['submitX'] exists instead!

","Oldish post but I think there is a solution that has been missed here. The button[type=submit] has always had problems with inconsistent behaviour, particularly with old IEs, and from @Mark's tests looks like we still have problems. Instead you can use two different values for the name attribute of the input[type=submit] and parse these server-side to get the correct action. For example, you can do: &lt;form method=""get"" action=""""&gt; &lt;input type=""text"" name=""txt""/&gt; &lt;input type=""submit"" name=""action[do_something]"" value=""Do Something Cool""/&gt; &lt;input type=""submit"" name=""action[do_another]"" value=""Do Something Dangerous""/&gt; &lt;/form&gt; Only the successful (clicked or default) name-value pair gets submitted so, say, in PHP you can easily do something like: &lt;?php if (isset($_GET['action']['do_something'])) { // do something } else { // do another thing } ?&gt; Note the default action will always be the first that appears in the source.

927,"I have to update one element on page with Ajax, do I have to make changes to server side, or is it possible to load whole page with jquery and then update only for example one element? ","You don't have to, and it is possible, but I would argue that you shouldn't. One of the advantages of AJAX is that you are pulling a fragment off the server, and thus a smaller payload. If you're pulling the entire page again, it will execute all the database queries, many of which will be unrelated to your element. You will also request all CSS/JS again, all text, etc. I would make a separate page for the individual fragment and request that via AJAX and update the element with just the returned result. However you can do it, and jQuery provides this through its load method: http://api.jquery.com/load/ Loading Page Fragments The .load() method, unlike $.get(), allows us to specify a portion of the remote document to be inserted. This is achieved with a special syntax for the url parameter. If one or more space characters are included in the string, the portion of the string following the first space is assumed to be a jQuery selector that determines the content to be loaded. "

Another alternative to make the tests even shorter would be: private void AssertInvalidChange(Action&lt;Foo&gt; change) { Foo foo = CreateValidFoo(); change(foo); Assert.IsFalse(foo.IsValid); } Then each test can just be of the form: public void FooWithNullNameIsInvalid() { AssertInvalidChange(foo =&gt; foo.Name = null); } Now at that stage you could put all the validity tests in a single method, with one line per invalid change. That would certainly be simpler, but it would violate the ""only test one thing"" mantra. Personally I'm fairly loose with that - I would be fairly strongly tempted to do this. The downside is that if you have multiple tests that would fail, you'll only see one failure at a time. "

940,"Is it normal to have tests that are way bigger than the actual code being tested? For every line of code I am testing I usually have 2-3 lines in the unit test. Which ultimately leads to tons of time being spent just typing the tests in (mock, mock and mock more). Where are the time savings? Do you ever avoid tests for code that is along the lines of being trivial? Most of my methods are less than 10 lines long and testing each one of them takes a lot of time, to the point where, as you see, I start questioning writing most of the tests in the first place. I am not advocating not unit testing, I like it. Just want to see what factors people consider before writing tests. They come at a cost (in terms of time, hence money), so this cost must be evaluated somehow. How do you estimate the savings created by your unit tests, if ever? ",You might be testing the wrong thing - you should not have different tests for every method in your code. You might have too many tests because you test implementation and not functionality - try testing how things are done test what is done. For example if you have a customer that is entitled to get a discount on every order - create a customer with the correct data and create an order for that customer and then make sure that the final price is correct. That way you actually test the business logic and not how it's done internally. Another reason is for big tests is lack of Isolation (a.k.a mocking) if you need to initialize difficult objects that require a lot of code try using fakes/mocks instead. And finally if you have complicated tests it might be a smell - if you need to write a lot of code to test a simple functionality it might mean that your code is tightly coupled and your APIs are not clear enough. 
941,"Basically I am attempting to have an AI agent navigate a world based on given percepts. My issue is handling how the agent moves.

942,"I've read through many of the questions on SO about this, but many answers contradict each other or I don't understand. You should always store a password as a hash, never as plain text. But should you store the salt (unique for each user) next to the hashed password+salt in the database. This doesn't seem very clever to me as couldn't someone gain access to the database, look for says the account called Admin or whatever and then work out the password from that? ","A lot of people are saying ""to stop rainbow tables"" without explaining what rainbow tables do or why this stops them. Rainbow tables are a clever way of precomputing a large number of hashes and storing them in less memory than would naively be required, and you can use them to very quickly reverse a hash. Tables for bare functions such as hash = md5(password) and hash = sha1(password) are common. However, they can be generated for ANY hash function which can be described as output = f(input). If you use a site-wide salt for all user passwords, for example hash = md5(salt+password), you could construct a function f, f(password) = md5(salt+password). Therefore you could generate rainbow tables for this function, which would take a long time, but would then let you crack every single password in the database very rapidly. If the salt is different for each password, you can't generate a rainbow table that will crack all passwords in the database. You could generate a new one for every user but that would be pointless - naive brute-forcing would be no slower. So having a seperate salt for each user stops the rainbow tables attack. There are several ways to do accomplish this. Popular ways include: A separate salt for each user, stored alongside their other details in the database: hash = hashfunction(salt + password) A global salt and some unique value per user: hash = hashfunction(salt + password + user_id) for example A global salt and a per-user salt: hash = hashfunction(global_salt + user_salt + password) Having a global salt could add a little extra complexity to cracking the passwords, as it could be stored outside of the database (in the code, for example) which attackers may not gain access to in the event of a database breach. Cryptographically I don't think it adds much, but in practice it could slow them down. Finally, to answer your actual question: Storing the salt alongside the user data does not weaken the hash. Hash functions are one-way: Given the hash of a password, even an unsalted one, it is very difficult to find that password. The motivation behind salting is not to make an individual hash more secure, but to make the collection of multiple hashes more secure. There are several vectors of attack for a collection of unsalted hashes: Rainbow tables Hashing common passwords (123, password, god) and seeing if any exist in the database, and then compromise those accounts Look for identical hashes in the database, which means identical passwords (probably) "

946,"I wrote this post Music and Mathematics, finding the Natural and the Pentatonic scales. I want to find the best programmatic aproach. A solution could be: &lt;script&gt; function getScaleIntervals(c) { var tot = 0; var scale = []; while(tot &lt;= 12){ scale.push(Math.round(tot)); tot += c; } return scale; } var natural_scale = getScaleIntervals(12/7); document.write(natural_scale + "" \n""); // ==&gt; 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12 var pentatonic_scale = getScaleIntervals(12/5); document.write(pentatonic_scale + "" \n""); // ==&gt; 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12 &lt;/script&gt; The resultant intervals starts with D (Re) in 0 so you have D E F G A B C D This is the Dorian Mode ","Your question (as written) is ambiguous. If you mean &quot;can your algorithm be used to generate natural scales?&quot; (those containing all natural notes, i.e. notes that are neither sharp nor flat), then yes, but only one (unless you allow for different rounding methods, in which case you get one natural scale per rounding method) and only by cherry picking a tonic. If you mean &quot;does your algorithm, by itself, result in a natural scale?&quot;, then the answer is no because it does not, by itself, generate a scale; it generates a mode. Note: in this answer, all named modes (e.g. Ionian) refer to the modern definitions. In terms of semitones, your algorithm results in intervals (from the tonic) of 0,2,3,5,7,9,10,12, which corresponds to a semitone sequence (i.e. scale steps) of 2-1-2-2-2-1-2, or Dorian mode. Note that the algorithm doesn't determine the tonic (the first note in a scale), so it doesn't give you a specific scale, which is a sequence of pitches, such as C-major or Dorian mode in D. In terms of the named intervals from the tonic, the Dorian mode contains the major 2nd, minor 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, major 6th, minor 7th, and perfect 8th. C major is M2, M3, P4, P5, M6, M7, P8 (all major or perfect intervals). Generating Other Modes Your choice of rounding function is arbitrary. If you always round up (⌈i*12/7⌉), you get the intervals 0,2,4,6,7,9,11,12 and semitone sequence 2-2-2-1-2-2-1, which is Lydian mode. Rounding down (⌊i*12/7⌋) gets you intervals 0,1,3,5,6,8,10,12 and steps 1-2-2-1-2-2-2, which is Locrian mode. None of these are the intervals or semitone sequence for the natural scale in C (i.e. Ionian mode in C, or C major), which is 0,2,4,5,7,9,11,12 and 2-2-1-2-2-2-1, respectively. If you expand the algorithm to use a different rounding function for each term rather than the same rounding function for all, you can generate the other named modes (e.g. (_, ceil, ceil, floor, ceil, ceil, ceil, _), where _ means &quot;don't care&quot;, will generate Ionian), but you will also generate many other modes that can't result in a natural scale. You can generate a total of 2n-1 modes this way, where n is the number of tones (I'm covering n=7, or heptatonic modes). The number of heptatonic modes equals the number of compositions of 12 of length 7, which is 11C6=462, so this method won't generate all modes. If we define roundr(x) = floor(x+r), we can generate only the diatonic modes (the 7 named modes, or Heptatonia Prima, which maximally separate the semitone steps) using this rounding function by limiting r to i/7, where i ∈ [0, 7) ⊂ ℕ. For example, Ionian is roundTo5/7(i*12/7) for i ∈ [0, 7) (note: round-to-nearest is roundTo0.5(x)). With this last approach, we can generate modes that can generate all 7 natural scales. Diatonic(n) = &lt;roundTon/7(x*12/7) for x in ∈ [0, 7)&gt; where &lt;...&gt; indicates a tuple (i.e. a finite sequence). Generating Scales Your algorithm only generates modes, but those can be used to generate scales. Depending on which note you pick to start on (the tonic), you'll get different scales for a given mode. Dorian results in a minor scale because it includes the minor third (the first two semitone steps in Dorian are 2-1, which sum to 3, the minor third) and perfect fifth (the sequence starts with 2-1-2-2, giving 7 semitones above the tonic). Lydian gives you a major scale because it includes the major third (it's semitone sequence starts with 2-2, which sums to 4, the major third) and perfect fifth (2-1-2-2). Locrian doesn't include the perfect fifth, so it's neither major nor minor. Generating Natural Scales To see which natural scales your algorithm can generate, let ADLO(n, round, tonic) stand for the scale resulting from the generalized version of your algorithm, where n is the number of pitches per octave, round is the rounding function and tonic is the tonic for a scale. If any is unspecified, the result is a collection of all possible values (thus ADLO(7, nearest) is all scales in Dorian mode). A named mode and tonic will be used for the scale in that mode with that tonic (e.g. Ionian('C') is C-major); a named mode with no tonic (e.g. Ionian()) will stand for the set of all scales in that mode. {} denotes a set, and &lt;&gt; a sequence. ADLO(7, nearest) = Dorian() = Diatonic(3) { &lt;C, D, D#, F, G, A, A#, C&gt;, &lt;D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D&gt;, &lt;E, F#, G, A, B, C#, D, E&gt;, &lt;F, G, G#, A#, C, D, D#, F&gt;, &lt;G, A, A#, C, D, E, F, G&gt;, &lt;A, B, C, D, E, F#, G, A&gt;, &lt;B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A, B&gt; } ADLO(7, ceil) = Lydian() = Diatonic(6) { &lt;C, D, E, F#, G, A, B, C&gt;, &lt;D, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D&gt;, &lt;E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E&gt;, &lt;F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F&gt;, &lt;G, A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G&gt;, &lt;A, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A&gt;, &lt;B, C#, D#, F, F#, G#, A#, B&gt; } ADLO(7, floor) = Locrian() = Diatonic(0) { &lt;C, C#, D#, F, F#, G#, A#, C&gt;, &lt;D, D#, F, G, G#, A#, C, D&gt;, &lt;E, F, G, A, A#, C, D, E&gt;, &lt;F, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, F&gt;, &lt;G, G#, A#, C, C#, D#, F, G&gt;, &lt;A, A#, C, D, D#, F, G, A&gt;, &lt;B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B&gt; } Thus we see that if you and pick * round to nearest D * round down B * round up F * ... as the tonic, you get a natural scale. Also, ADLO(7, roundTo5/7(x)) = Ionian() = Diatonic(5) ADLO(7, roundTo3/7(x)) = Dorian() = Diatonic(3) ADLO(7, roundTo1/7(x)) = Phrygian() = Diatonic(1) ADLO(7, roundTo6/7(x)) = Lydian() = Diatonic(6) ADLO(7, roundTo4/7(x)) = Mixolydian() = Diatonic(4) ADLO(7, roundTo2/7(x)) = Aeolian() = Diatonic(2) ADLO(7, roundTo0/7(x)) = Locrian() = Diatonic(0) Which note to pick as the tonic is also given as the &quot;white note&quot; in the Wikipedia article on modes in modern music. Computational Correctness The reason the code works to generate a mode is that the notes in a diatonic scale are as evenly distributed among the semitones as is possible. i*n/m, for i ∈ [0, m), is an even distribution of m things among n things. Round those values and you get a distribution that's as even as possible among integers from 0 through n. Thus your algorithm results a diatonic mode. This isn't all that significant a result; it's a rather simple consequence of rounding. "

As i am using ajax calls for all my Add,Edit and Delete operations in my website it works pretty well as of now... Still knowing about the disadvantages would make life easier during deployment.... ","The best use of AJAX is where it is used to send small payloads. Here is a simple example. I load a page that contains information about stock. It has graphs, charts, company information and it also displays the share-price. Every 30 seconds, I make an AJAX request that gets the updated share-price and changes it on the page. Without AJAX, I might decide to refresh the entire page every 30 seconds, but with AJAX, I can just make a lightweight request to get the tiny bit of information I need. Using AJAX to submit forms isn't always the best bet. Asides from not really giving you a clear advantage over posting the form normally, you break conventions such as browser history (although some browsers now include JavaScript ""states"" as pages in the history). When using AJAX, you need to handle the task of telling the user if something has gone wrong. You can do this with jQuery by specifying what should happen on error, but many people forget to do this and the end user is blissfully unaware of any problem. Other issues to watch out for are any JavaScript errors that may prevent your events from firing - or if JavaScript is disabled, in either case ensuring that the form can submit normally before you add the AJAX code is the safest option.

952,Using a .NET TcpClient if I have called an asynchronous BeginRead() on the associated network stream can I still call Write() on that stream on another thread? Or do I have to lock() the TcpClient in the code that is called back from the BeginRead and the code that does the send? Also if I close the TcpClient with: client.GetStream().Close(); client.Close(); Do I have to lock() on the TcpClient as well? ,"The read/write portions of the TcpClient are thread safe, as explained in the documentation for the NetworkStream class (which is what the TcpClient uses for its actual IO): Read and write operations can be performed simultaneously on an instance of the NetworkStream class without the need for synchronization. As long as there is one unique thread for the write operations and one unique thread for the read operations, there will be no cross-interference between read and write threads and no synchronization is required. To do with the closing, if you close the TcpClient on one thread, but then try to read/write using it on another thread after it is closed, an exception will be thrown. You can either synchronise the threads before it is closed in order to prevent them using the TcpClient, or just catch and handle the exception (for example, you might exit the thread's executing loop).

","All depends on the scripts you run but under normal circumstances everything should be fine if you take the migration guide into account.

Since Magento is such a wonderful and high quality product you shouldn't have any problems using that on a php5.2 server but I'd be careful anyway. My advise would be to leave the hosting for the PHPCart system intact and set up a separate (local) dev/staging server with php5.2 to start implementing Magento.

Edit: From the MonoTouch Troubleshooting page Debugger is unable to connect with the device When you start debugging a device configuration, you will see the debugger show a dialog indicating that it is listening on a particular IP address. This IP address is also built into the application as a default setting. When you start the application in debug mode, it makes a connection to MonoDevelop, the debugger host. If it is unable to connect, the device will vibrate once. There are several reasons the application may not be able to connect to the debugger: If the device and the debugger host are on different networks, a firewall or private network may be preventing the application from connecting to the debugger host. MonoDevelop may picked the wrong host IP address. MonoDevelop picks the first IP address on the machine, which, if you have multiple network interfaces, may not be the one you want. You can override the IP that MonoDevelop uses by quitting MonoDevelop and editing its settings file. This is in a hidden directory in in your home directory, ~/.config/MonoDevelop/MonoDevelopProperties.xml. Look for the key ""MonoTouch.Debugger.HostIP"", and edit the value. If it is not present you will need to add it: view plainprint? where w.x.y.z is the IP you wish to use. The debugger host's IP address may have changed. MonoDevelop has to embed the host's IP address in the application's default settings so that it knows what address to connect to. If the host's IP changes after you build the app, you need to rebuild and re-upload the app, or change the IP address entry in the app's settings on the device. "

960,"I'm trying to encode some denotational semantics into Agda based on a program I wrote in Haskell. data Value = FunVal (Value -&gt; Value) | PriVal Int | ConVal Id [Value] | Error String In Agda, the direct translation would be; data Value : Set where FunVal : (Value -&gt; Value) -&gt; Value PriVal : ℕ -&gt; Value ConVal : String -&gt; List Value -&gt; Value Error : String -&gt; Value but I get an error relating to the FunVal because; Value is not strictly positive, because it occurs to the left of an arrow in the type of the constructor FunVal in the definition of Value. What does this mean? Can I encode this in Agda? Am I going about it the wrong way? Thanks. ","HOAS doesn't work in Agda, because of this: apply : Value -&gt; Value -&gt; Value apply (FunVal f) x = f x apply _ x = Error ""Applying non-function"" w : Value w = FunVal (\x -&gt; apply x x) Now, notice that evaluating apply w w gives you apply w w back again. The term apply w w has no normal form, which is a no-no in agda. Using this idea and the type: data P : Set where MkP : (P -&gt; Set) -&gt; P We can derive a contradiction. One of the ways out of these paradoxes is only to allow strictly positive recursive types, which is what Agda and Coq choose. That means that if you declare: data X : Set where MkX : F X -&gt; X That F must be a strictly positive functor, which means that X may never occur to the left of any arrow. So these types are strictly positive in X: X * X Nat -&gt; X X * (Nat -&gt; X) But these are not: X -&gt; Bool (X -&gt; Nat) -&gt; Nat -- this one is ""positive"", but not strictly (X * Nat) -&gt; X So in short, no you can't represent your data type in Agda. You can use de Bruijn encoding to get a term type you can work with, but usually the evaluation function needs some sort of ""timeout"" (generally called ""fuel""), e.g. a maximum number of steps to evaluate, because Agda requires all functions to be total. Here is an example due to @gallais that uses a coinductive partiality type to accomplish this. "

Something maybe like: $mime = file_get_contents(&quot;php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode:line-length=76/resource=$binary&quot;); I imagine the issue is that the parameter has to be passed as an array when stream_filter_append is used.

966,Tornadoweb and Nginx are popular web servers for the moment and many benchmarkings show that they have a better performance than Apache under certain circumstances. So my question is: Is 'epoll' the most essential reason that make them so fast? And what can I learn from that if I want to write a good socket server? ,"If you're looking to write a socket server, a good starting point is Dan Kegel's C10k article from a few years back: http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html I also found Beej's Guide to Network Programming to be pretty handy: http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/ Finally, if you need a great reference, there's UNIX Network Programming by W. Richard Stevens et. al.: http://www.amazon.com/Unix-Network-Programming-Sockets-Networking/dp/0131411551/ref=dp_ob_title_bk Anyway, to answer your question, the main difference between Apache and Nginx is that Apache uses one thread per client with blocking I/O, whereas Nginx is single-threaded with non-blocking I/O. Apache's worker pool does reduce the overhead of starting and destorying processes, but it still makes the CPU switch between several threads when serving multiple clients. Nginx, on the other hand, handles all requests in one thread. When one request needs to make a network request (say, to a backend), Nginx attaches a callback to the backend request and then works on another active client request. In practice, this means it returns to the event loop (epoll, kqueue, or select) and asks for file descriptors that have something to report. Note that the system call in main event loop is actually a blocking operation, because there's nothing to do until one of the file descriptors is ready for reading or writing. So that's the main reason Nginx and Tornado are efficient at serving many simultaneous clients: there's only ever one process (thus saving RAM) and only one thread (thus saving CPU from context switches). As for epoll, it's just a more efficient version of select. If there are N open file descriptors (sockets), it lets you pick out the ones ready for reading in O(1) instead of O(N) time. In fact, Nginx can use select instead of epoll if you compile it with the --with-select_module option, and I bet it will still be more efficient than Apache. I'm not as familiar with Apache internals, but a quick grep shows it does use select and epoll -- probably when the server is listening to multiple ports/interfaces, or if it does simultaneous backend requests for a single client. Incidentally, I got started with this stuff trying to write a basic socket server and wanted to figure out how Nginx was so freaking efficient. After poring through the Nginx source code and reading those guides/books I linked to above, I discovered it'd be easier to write Nginx modules instead of my own server. Thus was born the now-semi-legendary Emiller's Guide to Nginx Module Development: http://www.evanmiller.org/nginx-modules-guide.html (Warning: the Guide was written against Nginx 0.5-0.6 and APIs may have changed.) If you're doing anything with HTTP, I'd say give Nginx a shot because it's worked out all the hairy details of dealing with stupid clients. For example, the small socket server that I wrote for fun worked great with all clients -- except Safari, and I never figured out why. Even for other protocols, Nginx might be the right way to go; the eventing is pretty well abstracted from the protocols, which is why it can proxy HTTP as well as IMAP. The Nginx code base is extremely well-organized and very well-written, with one exception that bears mentioning. I wouldn't follow its lead when it comes to hand-rolling a protocol parser; instead, use a parser generator. I've written some stuff about using a parser generator (Ragel) with Nginx here: http://www.evanmiller.org/nginx-modules-guide-advanced.html#parsing All of this was probably more information than you wanted, but hopefully you'll find some of it useful.

967,"What is the reason for the following code that does not let me to create object. class base { public: void foo() { cout &lt;&lt; ""base::foo()""; } }; class derived : private base { public: void foo() { cout &lt;&lt; ""deived::foo()""; } }; void main() { base *d = new derived(); d-&gt;foo(); } It Gives me error : "" 'type cast' : conversion from 'derived *' to 'base *' exists, but is inaccessible"" Thanks in advance :) ","The problem is that you are using private inheritance; this means that inheritance can only be seen inside your class (in this case, derived). You cannot point a base* to a derived instance outside your class (in this case, in main()) because the inheritance (and hence, the conversion) cannot be accessed. This is exactly the same as trying to access a private member from outside a class. In fact, the name ""private inheritance"" is quite misleading, since it does not implement real inheritance. In your example, a derived instance is not a base; it is just implemented in terms of a base, and this is what ""private inheritance"" means. If you are tempted to use private inheritance, you should consider the possibility of using simple aggregation (i.e.: a private pointer to base inside derived) instead. In most cases (most cases, not always), private inheritance offers no advantages and has some subtle problems. "

Now if the user edits from German format to 65,89875 which is 65.89875 equivalent in English, and the other user views from an English browser it comes as 6589875. This happens because in the database it was stored as 65,89875 in the nvarchar column and when converted using English culture it becomes 6589875 since it considers , as a separator which is a decimal operator for German. How do I get this working for all the browsers? ","You need to define a single locale that you will use for the data stored in the database, the invariant culture is there for exactly this purpose. When you display convert to the native type and then format for the user's culture.

971,Does java have an equivalent operator or language construct as the verbatim operator(@) in C#? ,"Quick Googling tells me that verbatim operator in C# is apparently just syntactic sugar. No, there's no equivalent in Java. Java isn't about syntactic sugar, the main focus of Java as a language is to provide only one way to perform or otherwise get a single function, that's why each reserved word in Java has only one function and a lot of syntactic sugar is missing. Just to emphasise, @ is already reserved for annotations. While the benefits and shortcomings of this can be discussed to eternity, the bottom line is that Java is really sparse in syntactic sugar, in fact only syntactic sugar in Java I can think of is the enhanced for loop and even then internally JVM knows only of while loops, anyway.

976,"Currently I am working on a production app. One function acts like the settings.app on iPhone. When the user click a cell of a tableView, as shown below http://www.penguintech.net/images/stackoverflow/1.png It will push another view, which includes a textfield to let user input something. However, on both simulator and device, after the app just loaded, the delay between clicking and showing the second view takes around 2 seconds. Then if user get back to previous view and click again, it will be no delay at all. To detect which method makes the delay, I put a NSLog() in every involved methods, but when I was inspecting the console while running the app, all NSLog() message showed in 0.1 seconds, and then still a delay on the app. Is there any other way to trace the performance footage of a app? The Instruments shows only CPU usage in Mac OS not in iPhone. ","Instruments should work for the device too. Build and run on the device using Instruments. Your device has to be connected to the computer while you do this. This will show you information about the memory etc while the app is running on your device. It sounds like the delay is in setting up your view. One likely cause is that you are loading something from the Internet in the view (perhaps an image that you have to download?). If that's the cause, you should do the slow work asynchronously. I'm not a debugging expert, but I've heard that Shark is better for performance problems.

977,"I have an HTML file and I want to use javascript to call a JSP file. It doesn't have to be javascript, I'm just looking for the easiest way to call the JSP file from the HTML file. How can I do this? Thanks. ","HTML/CSS/JavaScript runs at the client side. Java/JSP runs at the server side. The client and server are two distinct environments which usually runs at physically different machines, connected with each other by a network with the communication protocol being HTTP. When the client requests a specific URL at the server, the server will run specific Java/JSP code and return a HTML/CSS/JS response back to the client. The client (webbrowser) will in turn execute the HTML/CSS/JS. Knowing this fact, it should be obvious that the only way to let JavaScript access/invoke some Java/JSP code is to send a HTTP request to the server side. This can be done in several ways: using window.location to do a synchronous GET request, or form.submit() to do a synchronous GET or POST request, or XMLHttpRequest#send() to do an asynchronous (ajaxical) request. But you after all don't need JavaScript for this at all. A simple HTML link or form is also sufficient. &lt;a href=""page.jsp""&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;form action=""page.jsp""&gt; &lt;input type=""submit""&gt; &lt;/form&gt; This will open the JSP file. If you'd like to run some business stuff prior to opening the JSP page, then better let the URL point to a Servlet like &lt;a href=""page""&gt; which in turn forwards the request to the JSP page like request.getRequestDispatcher(""/WEB-INF/page.jsp"").forward(request, response); To learn more about the wall between Java/JSP and JavaScript you may find this article useful.

983,"I'm moving a character (ellipsoid) around in my physics engine. The movement must be constrained by the static geometry, but should slide on the edges, so it won't be stuck. My current approach is to move it a little and then push it back out of the geometry. It seems to work, but I think it's mostly because of luck. I fear there must be some corner cases where this method will go haywire. For example a sharp corner where two walls keeps pushing the character into each other. How would a ""state of the art"" game engine solve this? ","I have not developed a state of the art game engine, but I once wrote a racing game where collision was simply handled by reversing the simulation time and calculate where the edge was crossed. Then the car was allowed to bounce back into the game field. The penalty was that the controls was disabled until the car stopped. So my suggestion is that you run your physics engine to calculate exactly where the edge is hit (it might need some non-linear equation solving approach), then you change your velocity vector to either bounce off or follow the edge. In the case of protecting against corner cases, one could always keep a history of the last valid position within the game and state of the physics engine. If the game gets stuck, the simulation can be restarted from that point but with a different condition (say by adding some randomization to the internal parameters). "
